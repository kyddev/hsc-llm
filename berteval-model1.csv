1,Define 'asexual reproduction',"Asexual reproduction is a type of reproductive process in which offspring are produced from one parent without the involvement of gametes (sex cells). In this process, the genetic material from two separate parents is combined to produce offspring that are genetically identical to both parents.","Asexual reproduction is the process by which an organism produces offspring without involving gametes or genetic recombination. This type of reproduction occurs when a single parent cell divides to produce new cells, resulting in identical clones of the original cell. Examples of asexual reproduction include binary fission in bacteria and protists, budding in plants and animals, and vegetative propagation in plants.",0.635,0.709,0.67
2,Identify the sort of cell division that is involved in asexual reproduction,"The cell division in asexual reproduction is mitosis, which produces an extra set of identical paired chromosomes.","The type of cell division involved in asexual reproduction is binary fission, budding, or other methods such as fragmentation or vegetative propagation. In bacteria, for example, cell division occurs through binary fission, where the parent cell duplicates its contents and then divides into two daughter cells. Similarly, protists can reproduce asexually by binary fission or budding.",0.547,0.689,0.61
3,Outline the ideal environmental conditions for asexual reproduction and explain why these conditions are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms,"Stable and uniform environments with a good supply of resources provide ideal conditions for asexual reproduction. These environments are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms because organisms that are produced via asexual reproduction are clones of their parent already adapted to the stable environment. Since the parent is surviving in the ideal environment, the offspring will also be well suited to this environment, resulting in a large successful population for this organism. However, they will lack the genetic variation required for adaptation to changing conditions.","The ideal environmental conditions for asexual reproduction typically include a watery environment, with some organisms requiring specific aquatic conditions. For example, some plants can reproduce asexually in harsh environments, whereas others may require certain factors such as temperature or light to propagate. Asexually reproducing organisms generally thrive in situations where there is limited defense against predators or environmental stressors, and variation within the population provides little benefit.",0.621,0.62,0.62
4,List the key events in binary fission for bacteria,"The key events that happen in binary fission for bacteria goes as follows:

1. The circular DNA molecule is duplicated within the nucleoid. 
2. The cell grows until it has almost doubled in size. 
3. A new cell wall and membrane form between the separating chromosomes, dividing the cell into two relatively equal halves. 
4. These halves eventually separate, forming two identical daughter cells from the single parent cell.","Here are the key events in binary fission for bacteria:

* The single chromosome replicates during reproduction
* Both chromosomes move to opposite sides of the cell
* The cell then elongates (gets ready to divide into two)
* Cytokinesis occurs, where the plasma membrane grows inwards at the centre and a new cell wall starts to form for each daughter cell, both containing a single chromosome

Binary fission usually results in the formation of two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent.",0.643,0.647,0.645
5,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a gamete? Give an example of each,"Somatic cells are all the diploid cells in the body of an organism, apart from the sex cells (gametes). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells. Gametes are the haploid sex cells such as the egg/ovum and sperm cells, that combine in sexual reproduction. They are produced from germ cells by meiosis

","A somatic cell is a type of cell that is not responsible for reproduction, whereas a gamete is a reproductive cell that can give rise to a new individual. An example of a somatic cell is a muscle cell or nerve cell, while an example of a gamete is a sperm or egg cell.

In humans, the number of chromosomes in a somatic cell (diploid) is 46, whereas the number of chromosomes in a gamete (haploid) is 23. This difference allows for the unique combination of genetic information from each parent that occurs during reproduction.",0.618,0.666,0.641
6,Explain the meaning of the term 'alternation of generations',The term ‘alternation of generations’ means the swapping between haploid (1n) and diploid (2n) stages in the life cycle of eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction. An example is the diploid mushroom fruiting body that produces haploid spores for the next stage.,"The term ""alternation of generations"" refers to the process by which genetic information is passed from one generation to the next through the reproductive cycle. This involves the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells) during meiosis, followed by fertilization and the creation of a new individual with a unique set of chromosomes. The alternation of generations is essential for the evolution and diversity of species, as it allows for the expression of genetic variation and the selection of advantageous traits through natural processes such as mutation, gene flow, and genetic drift.",0.54,0.552,0.546
7,Compare pollination in gymnosperm and angiosperm plants,"Both gymnosperms and angiosperms produce haploid male gametes contained inside pollen grains. 

The difference is in the way that cross-pollination occurs. All cone plants (gymnosperms) are wind pollinated, that is, they produce very lightweight pollen in great quantities on male cones and release it into the air to be carried by wind. By chance some will pollinate female cones of the same gymnosperm species. 

Most flowering plants (angiosperms) have adaptations for more reliable cross-pollination, often involving a symbiotic relationship with an animal. Insects (especially bees), birds and small mammals are attracted to the flowers by colour or scent. They get rewards of nectar or pollen and in the process carry pollen grains from one flower to the next. Some angiosperms are wind-pollinated but most have evolved the more efficient pollination partnership with an animal species.","Pollination in gymnosperms and angiosperms share some similarities, but also have distinct differences. Both groups produce seeds that contain the embryo, but angiosperms have ovules protected within an ovary, whereas gymnosperms have seeds that are not protected by an ovary. 

In both groups, pollination involves the transfer of male gametes to female structures. However, angiosperms typically rely on external agents like wind or animals for pollination, while gymnosperms use cones to reproduce, with pollen from a male cone blown by wind onto a female cone. This difference reflects the unique characteristics and adaptations of each group.",0.671,0.603,0.635
8,Classify the three groups of mammals based on reproductive strategies and give two examples for each group,"All mammals have fur and feed their young with milk. There are three groups based on reproductive strategies: 

1. placental mammals—female carries fetus inside her body, nourished through a placenta until fully developed (e.g. human, dog, lion, elephant and whale) 
2. marsupial mammals—fetus born at an early stage, complete their development in external pouch while suckling (e.g. kangaroo, koala, wombat and quokka) 
3. monotreme mammals—female lays eggs with leathery shells then protects them and feeds the young with milk after hatching (e.g. platypus and echidna)
","Based on the provided documents, mammals can be classified into three groups based on reproductive strategies:

1. External Fertilization: This group includes animals that reproduce outside of their bodies, such as frogs. Examples include amphibians like toads and some species of fish.

2. Internal Fertilization: This group includes animals that reproduce inside their bodies, such as mammals (including humans). Advantages of internal fertilization include the protection of gametes, reduced energy expenditure, and a greater chance of successful reproduction. Examples include dogs, lions, and other mammalian species.

3. Asexual Reproduction: This group includes organisms that produce offspring without the involvement of males or females, such as some plant species. However, since mammals are not asexual reproducers, this category is not directly applicable to mammals.

It's worth noting that while these categories can be useful for understanding reproductive strategies in general, they may not apply perfectly to all mammalian species.",0.53,0.569,0.549
9,"Distinguish between zygote, morula, blastocyst, gastrula, embryo and fetus","Zygote is the first stage after fertilisation, the diploid cell that results from fusion of a haploid egg and sperm. 

Morula is the next stage after the zygote undergoes mitosis to become two cells. The morula continues to divide until it consists of 16 cells and then enters the uterus. 

Blastocyst is the next stage when the morula has divided by mitosis into many smaller cells that are organised into two layers. 

Gastrula develops from the blastocyst when three layers of cells have formed. 

Embryo is the next stage until major organs have developed. In humans this stage is from three to eight weeks after fertilisation (or five to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period). 

Fetus is the final stage of development when all of the major organs have developed. This stage lasts until birth.","Here is a concise and complete response to distinguish between zygote, morula, blastocyst, gastrula, embryo, and fetus:

A zygote is the fertilized egg cell formed by the fusion of a sperm and an ovum. It develops into a morula, which undergoes mitosis to become 16 cells. The morula then becomes a blastocyst, where implantation occurs in the uterus. The blastocyst differentiates into three layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, forming a gastrula. This eventually develops into an embryo, characterized by further specialization of tissues and organs. Finally, the embryo becomes a fetus, marking the final stage of development until birth.",0.666,0.663,0.665
10,Where would you find an acrosome and what is its function?,"The acrosome is a specialized structure at the front (or anterior) of a sperm cell. It contains enzymes called acroplasms or hyaluronidases, which break down the outer layers around an egg (oocyte) to facilitate fertilization.","An acrosome is typically found in animal sperm cells. Its function is to store enzymes that help break down the outer layer of an egg cell, allowing the sperm to fertilize it.",0.751,0.665,0.705
11,Where would you find a follicle and what is its function?,"A follicle is a group of cells in the ovary that surround an oocyte as it matures. The follicle provides protection and nutrition to the egg, then ruptures to release the egg through the surface of the ovary for ovulation.","A follicle is a structure found in plants, specifically in the carpel (female reproductive part). Its function is to house the ovary and provide a pathway for pollen tubes to grow down from the stigma, allowing for fertilization. In animals, the equivalent structure is not called a follicle, but rather an ovum or egg cell, which is released from the ovaries and can be fertilized by sperm.",0.607,0.693,0.647
12,Compare reproduction in placental and marsupial mammals,"Both placentals and marsupials are viviparous, that is they bear live young. The difference is that marsupial young are born at a very early stage of their development before they are fully formed. The young must crawl up into the maternal pouch, attach to a nipple and complete their development in the external pouch. The mother can then start another cycle of reproduction and does not have the burden of growing the young in her uterus. Placental females nourish the fetus inside the uterus until it is fully formed. Some placental young can start moving around independently within minutes after birth (e.g. calves, lambs and foals). The young are better protected during fetal development, but the mother is more restricted by the period of gestation and cannot breed again until after the birth.","Here's a concise response comparing reproduction in placental and marsupial mammals:

Placental mammals, such as humans, have a longer gestation period where the fetus develops internally, receiving nutrients and waste removal through the placenta. In contrast, marsupials, like kangaroos, have a shorter gestation period and give birth to underdeveloped young that continue to develop outside the womb in their mother's pouch. This difference in reproductive strategy is likely influenced by factors such as energy investment and environmental unpredictability, with marsupials being better suited to Australia's arid conditions due to lower resting metabolic rates and unique reproductive advantages like embryonic diapause.",0.57,0.596,0.583
13,"Explain how two glands positioned in the brain, the hypothalamus and the pituitary, can control the reproductive organs","The hypothalamus acts as a master control centre, receiving information by nerve messages and by monitoring the blood as it flows through this area of the brain. It maintains homeostatic balance and reproductive processes for the body by sending out nerve messages and/or releasing hormones to other appropriate glands. The pituitary is thus controlled by messages from the hypothalamus for release of its hormones to act on target cells in the reproductive system. Hormones from the pituitary gland travel in the blood to their targets such as the mammary glands, the ovaries and testes. Some pituitary hormones act directly and others stimulate release of local hormones that act on their target cells by diffusing through the extracellular fluid.","The hypothalamus and pituitary gland work together to control the reproductive organs. The hypothalamus produces hormones that stimulate or inhibit the release of other hormones from the pituitary gland, which in turn regulates the ovaries and uterus. For example, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) triggers the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, while luteinizing hormone (LH) causes ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum. Estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries regulate the menstrual cycle and prepare the uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg.",0.617,0.618,0.617
14,Identify the steps of artificial selection that would lead to the production of large corn cobs,"The steps of artificial selection that would lead to production of large corn cobs include:

1. Select corn plants with the largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
2. Select offspring plants with largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
3. Continue this process until the population reliably produces large cobs.","To produce large corn cobs through artificial selection, the following steps can be taken:

* Identify the characteristic: Determine what makes a corn cob large, such as kernel size or ear shape.
* Select for the trait: Choose corn plants with larger cobs and use them to produce seeds for the next generation.
* Breed for the trait: Repeat the process of selecting and breeding for larger cobs over several generations to see improvement in the desired characteristic.
* Stabilize the trait: Once large cobs have been consistently produced, stabilize the trait by continuing to breed within a narrow range to maintain the desired characteristic.

Note that this is a simplified overview of the process, and actual implementation may require more detailed knowledge of corn breeding and genetics.",0.559,0.658,0.604
15,Outline how selective breeding has changed with the development of new technology,"Selective breeding traditionally used cross breeding over many generations. However, new technology allows desired genes to be transferred more rapidly and accurately, and allows creation of transgenic species.","Selective breeding has undergone significant changes with the development of new technology. In ancient times, selective breeding was a labor-intensive process that relied on natural mating habits and careful tracking of desirable traits. With the advent of artificial insemination and pollination, breeders can now more easily transfer desired genes between individuals or species, increasing the speed and efficiency of the process.

In modern times, advances in DNA manipulation have further expanded the possibilities for selective breeding. Recombinant DNA technology allows scientists to transfer genes between organisms or species, creating new combinations that may not occur naturally. This has led to increased biodiversity in the short term, as new gene combinations are introduced. However, long-term concerns arise when breeders focus on selecting for specific traits, potentially reducing genetic diversity and making populations more vulnerable to disease.

Overall, technological advancements have greatly enhanced our ability to selectively breed organisms, allowing us to create desirable traits and produce food animals or crops more efficiently.",0.546,0.693,0.611
16,Identity two common methods of plant propagation used in selective breeding,"Artificial pollination ensures that only the chosen male plant will fertilise the new seeds. Plant cuttings, grafting and using runners or suckers will produce identical plants for the next generation (e.g. for growing bananas commercially).","Two common methods of plant propagation used in selective breeding are:

1. Artificial pollination: This involves taking pollen from one flower and inserting it directly into another flower using a small brush, allowing for the creation of offspring with desirable characteristics.
2. Selective breeding: This method involves breeding plants that exhibit favorable traits, such as disease resistance or increased yield, to produce offspring with improved characteristics.

These methods enable farmers to selectively breed plants with specific characteristics, increasing crop yields and improving food security.",0.504,0.569,0.535
17,Outline four methods of cloning currently used in horticulture and agriculture,"The cloning methods used in agriculture and horticulture are: 
• cuttings and grafting 
• plant tissue culture 
• embryo splitting 
• nuclear transfer.","Four methods of cloning currently used in horticulture and agriculture are:

1. Whole-organism cloning: This method involves creating an exact genetic copy of a whole organism, which can be used to produce genetically uniform crops or livestock with desirable traits.

2. Transgenesis: This technique involves inserting genes from one species into the DNA of another species, allowing for the creation of organisms with multiple functions and the transfer of favourable traits.

3. Gene sequencing: This method allows for the identification of genetic disorders and risk factors in plants and animals, which can be used to improve crop yields or develop disease-resistant livestock.

4. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT): This technique involves transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell into an egg cell, which is then stimulated to divide and develop into an embryo, resulting in a genetically identical copy of the original organism.

These methods can be used to improve crop yields, increase disease resistance, and reduce pesticide use, among other benefits.",0.449,0.656,0.533
18,Recall a situation where plant tissue culture is of benefit,"An endangered species could be saved by producing many new plants from a small piece of the rare parent plant. This strategy has been used for the Wollemi pine. Mass production of food plants with tissue culture saves time, money and reduces land use.","One situation where plant tissue culture is of benefit is in the production of genetically diverse plants through sexual reproduction. Plant tissue culture allows for the controlled environment to induce flowering and produce seeds, which can then be used to increase genetic diversity within a plant species. This technique has been particularly useful in conservation efforts to preserve endangered plant species.",0.595,0.595,0.595
19,Discuss the case for and against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture. Use some specific examples in your answer.,"• For the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—Many benefits come from selective breeding
 evidenced by the fact that all our agricultural plants and animals have been improved for human use by controlling
 their breeding. We have more nutritious and palatable fruit like apples and grain crops. Farm animals are more
 productive for milk, eggs and meat.
 • Against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—One risk is that a GM species could start
 breeding with related wild species such as the GM salmon. We also risk a further reduction in natural genetic variation.
 There are also many ethical concerns around selectively breeding animals and the consequences for their welfare.","The manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, selective breeding can help produce offspring with desirable characteristics, such as disease resistance or high yield, which can improve crop quality and reduce pesticide use, as seen in the example of BT Cotton. This can also increase farm worker and neighbor safety. Additionally, artificial insemination and pollination can minimize transportation costs and ensure the reproduction of favorable traits.

However, there are also concerns about the impact on biodiversity and genetic diversity. Large-scale monocultures of genetically identical crops can outcompete native species and reduce ecosystem biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of a single male's sperm to inseminate many females can reduce genetic variation, potentially leading to a decrease in natural gene flow.

Overall, while breeding manipulation can have benefits, it is essential to consider its potential consequences on the environment and the long-term sustainability of agriculture.",0.576,0.622,0.598
20,"Within a cell cycle, cell replication involves three phases. Identify and summarise the three phases.","The cell cycle involves three phases: interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis.
 Interphase involves the cell doubling its mass and duplicating all its components. DNA replication occurs during
 interphase.
 Mitosis is a process of division of the cell nucleus.
 Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells.","The cell cycle involves three main phases: Interphase, Mitosis, and Cytokinesis.

Interphase is the longest phase where cells grow and prepare for division. It's divided into G1, S, and G2 phases. During this phase, DNA replication occurs in the S phase, resulting in two identical DNA molecules.

Mitosis is the stage where cell division takes place. It consists of Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase. This process results in one parent cell becoming two identical daughter cells.

Cytokinesis is the final stage where the cytoplasm divides, forming two new cells.",0.706,0.815,0.757
21,"Identify the two types of cell division, the number of daughter cells produced and the number of chromosomes in these daughter cells.","There are two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.

Mitosis: This process produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each having twice the number of chromosomes (2n). Mitosis is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in eukaryotes.
Meiosis: Meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes by half, resulting in four genetically distinct daughter cells. Each gamete has n chromosomes (23 in human sperm and egg). Meiosis increases genetic diversity, allowing for recombination and shuffling of alleles during sexual reproduction.","There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis produces 2 diploid, identical daughter cells, each containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Meiosis, on the other hand, produces 4 haploid, non-identical gametes from a diploid parent cell.",0.707,0.632,0.668
22,Recall the events that occur during interphase of the cell cycle,"During the S phase of interphase, DNA is synthesised (chromosomes are replicated); during G1 and G2—normal
 functioning of the cell occurs, the cell increases in size and replicates organelles, and materials are accumulated for
 mitosis; G0—resting phase or phase in which cells undergo cell differentiation to become specialised.","During the interphase of the cell cycle, the cell spends most of its time growing and preparing for cell division. This phase is divided into three stages: G1 (growth), S (synthesis or DNA replication), and G2 (preparation). During this time, proteins are used to replicate organelles, and DNA synthesis occurs through the process of DNA replication, resulting in two identical DNA molecules.",0.648,0.67,0.659
23,Distinguish between a chromatid and a chromosome. When are they visible?,"Chromatids are replicates of the chromosome, joined at the centromere. When they separate at anaphase they are
 again called chromosomes. Chromosomes and chromatids become visible under a light microscope when they
 condense in prophase (and stay visible through metaphase, anaphase and telophase).","A chromatid is one half of a replicated chromosome, while a chromosome is an individual DNA molecule that contains genes and carries genetic information. Chromatids are visible during certain stages of cell division, such as prophase, where they condense to form chromosomes. In other stages, like interphase, the DNA remains in its chromatin form and is not yet visible.",0.624,0.671,0.647
24,Explain how cell division in plants is different from cell division in animals,"Plant cells do not usually have a centriole (a structure present in animal cells); they form spindle fibres by a different
 mechanism, so chromosomes align and chromatids separate as in other eukaryotic cells. During cytokinesis the
 membrane does not constrict as it does in animals, but a new division (the cell plate) forms across the cell, making a
 new cell wall, then new cell membranes for each daughter cell.","Cell division in plants is different from cell division in animals in several ways. In plants, the process of cell division is characterized by a unique type of cell division called cytokinesis, which involves the formation of a new cell wall and the separation of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells. This process is distinct from the mitosis that occurs in animal cells, where the cytoplasm is not separated into distinct daughter cells.",0.634,0.605,0.619
25,"Define 'apoptosis'. Explain the reasons for this process in a healthy organism, providing examples.","Apoptosis is a natural and highly controlled process of cell death within a multicellular organism. It is used to control
 the number of cells, to destroy cells with DNA damaged beyond repair and remove cells that have reached their ‘useby date’ or are surplus to body requirements. Examples in humans include: old red and white blood cells, damaged
 skin and intestinal lining cells, monthly menstruation to remove the extra lining of the uterus if pregnancy hasn’t
 occurred; in a developing human embryo: removal of excess brain cells and webbing between the digits. Examples in
 plants include: the root cap cells are destroyed by apoptosis and replaced as penetration into the soil damages them.
 Destruction of targeted cells for these reasons helps keep an organism renewed and healthy.","Apoptosis is a process by which cells self-destruct to maintain tissue homeostasis and prevent uncontrolled cell growth. In healthy organisms, apoptosis plays a crucial role in regulating cell populations, removing damaged or dysfunctional cells, and eliminating unwanted cells during development.

For example, when the immune system identifies infected or abnormal cells, it triggers an apoptotic response to eliminate those cells and prevent their spread. Similarly, during embryonic development, apoptosis helps shape tissues and organs by selectively eliminating certain cells.

In addition to its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, apoptosis also has a broader impact on overall health, as it prevents the accumulation of damaged or mutated cells that could potentially become cancerous.",0.598,0.573,0.585
26,Outline the basic functions of DNA and RNA.,DNA carries the instructions that code for the production of RNA and proteins. DNA can self-replicate. RNA plays a major role in partnership with DNA for the process of protein synthesis,"The basic functions of DNA and RNA are:

DNA:

* Stores genetic information in a double-stranded molecule
* Contains nucleotides with four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine
* Replication occurs through the unzipping of the DNA helix by an enzyme called RNA polymerase

RNA (Ribonucleic acid):

* Found in small amounts in the nucleus and larger amounts in the cytoplasm
* Has four nucleotide bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil (instead of thymine)
* Functions include:
	+ mRNA (Messenger RNA): carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis
	+ rRNA (Ribosomal RNA): forms the ribosome, which makes proteins
	+ tRNA (Transfer RNA): carries amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis",0.424,0.599,0.496
27,"Distinguish between these terms: chromosome, DNA. genome, gene and allele.","A chromosome is a package of a single, very long DNA molecule coiled around a series of histone proteins.
 DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic information of organisms and determines their inherited characteristics.
 The genome of an organism is the sum total of an organism’s DNA, measured in the number of base pairs, contained
 in a haploid (n) set of chromosomes.
 A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a polypeptide. One or more polypeptides form proteins, which carry out
 functions in organisms.
 An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of the same gene (e.g. alleles for different eye colours).","Here's a concise response to distinguish between these terms:

* **Chromosome**: A segment of DNA that carries genetic information. It is made up of chromatin, which condenses to form chromosomes during cell division.
* **DNA** (Deoxyribonucleic acid): The molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms.
* **Genome**: The complete set of genetic material contained within an organism's DNA.
* **Gene**: A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait or characteristic. It is the smallest unit of heredity.

An allele refers to one variant of a gene, while a locus is the position of a gene on a chromosome.",0.583,0.633,0.607
28,"Using the terms chromosome, histone, DNA and nucleosome, describe how DNA is packaged into a cell nucleus","A long thread of DNA is packed up so that it fits into the nucleus of every cell. The DNA in each chromosome is tightly
 coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. The combined loop of DNA and histone
 is called a nucleosome. Next the nucleosomes are packaged into a thread, which is sometimes described as ‘beads
 on a string’. The end result is a fibre known as chromatin. The chromatin is looped and coiled again to produce a
 super-coiled thread-like structure called a chromosome.","Here's a concise response to your question:

DNA is packaged into a cell nucleus by wrapping around histone proteins to form nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are then compressed and coiled to make chromatin fibers, which ultimately form supercoils called chromatids. The combination of multiple chromatids results in the formation of chromosomes, with approximately 60% protein and 40% DNA composition.",0.65,0.658,0.654
29,How do cells ensure that the DNA is copied correctly to the daughter cells?,"A strand of the parent DNA molecule is used as a template strand on which the new complementary strand is
 synthesised. As each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old and one newly synthesised strand, the exact DNA
 pattern can be replicated accurately.","Cells ensure that DNA is copied correctly to daughter cells by using a process called DNA replication. During this process, an enzyme called helicase unzips the double-stranded DNA, and primers bind to the template strands at regular intervals. Then, nucleotides slot into place in a continuous process along the leading strand, with hydrogen bonding between base pairs ensuring faithful replication of the base sequence. Enzymes remove all RNA primers and fill vacant slots with the appropriate nucleotides, and fragments are fused together and checked for errors corrected by enzymes. This results in two identical molecules of DNA, each containing one strand from the original DNA and one new strand.",0.524,0.639,0.576
30,Assess the role of enzymes in DNA replication,"Enzymes are vital to the process of DNA replication, which would not begin or proceed without them. For example,
 separate enzymes manage the unzipping and rezipping of the two DNA strands. DNA polymerase is a complex of
 enzymes that selects and attaches the correct bases to the new strand and checks for errors at a rapid pace. Another
 enzyme manages the twisting tension of the double helix. Replication would not be possible without enzymes.","Enzymes play a crucial role in DNA replication, allowing for the accurate and efficient production of two identical double-stranded DNA molecules from one original molecule. Enzymes such as helicase, primase, topoisomerase, and DNA polymerase work together to unwind the DNA, form new strands, and connect Okazaki fragments. These enzymes ensure that DNA replication is semi-conservative, with each daughter strand containing one parent strand and one newly synthesized strand.",0.604,0.602,0.603
31,Recall the names of the two cell division processes and define their main features.,"Mitosis—produces identical new cells for growth and repair
 Meiosis—produces sex cells (gametes) for sexual reproduction with a different combination of alleles to the parent cell","The two main cell division processes are mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells, each with a complete set of chromosomes. It is used for growth and repair in multicellular organisms. Meiosis, on the other hand, is the process of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms and results in four unique daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.",0.528,0.647,0.581
32,Write a definition of ' species'.,"Members of the same species:
 • look alike (they are more alike in appearance than other organisms)
 • can interbreed in nature and their offspring are fertile (if they reproduce sexually)
 • cannot interbreed successfully with organisms outside their species group
 • have the same, or very similar, habitat requirements (i.e. have similar geographical distributions).","A species is defined as a group of living organisms that share common characteristics and can produce offspring with similar traits. This definition encompasses the idea of variation among members, heritability, reproduction, competition, and adaptation to their environment. In other words, a species is a distinct group of organisms that are capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring.",0.538,0.545,0.541
33,Examine the importance of cell division to a eukaryotic organism.,"Eukaryotes have two types of cell division—mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the basis of cell replication in unicellular
 eukaryotes. In multicellular eukaryotes, mitosis is used for growth, cell replacement and tissue repair. Meiosis is the
 basis of sexual reproduction in multicellular eukaryotes. It is essential to produce gametes, and enables two parents to
 contribute genetic information to the offspring and maintain genetic variation in new generations of offspring.","Cell division is crucial for the survival and growth of eukaryotic organisms. It allows cells to reproduce, repair damaged or worn-out cells, and maintain tissue homeostasis. In eukaryotes, cell division can occur through mitosis or meiosis, ensuring that genetic material is accurately distributed between daughter cells. This process is essential for maintaining the integrity of the organism and enabling it to respond to environmental stimuli.",0.668,0.685,0.677
34,Examine some of the main differences in gene regulation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.,"In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA processing occur within the nucleus, while translation occurs in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex and can be regulated at any stage. In prokaryotic cells, gene expression consists only of transcription and translation, and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells (as prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles). Here, transcription and translation occur at almost the same time. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated during transcription.","One of the main differences in gene regulation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is the presence of membrane-bound organelles, such as nuclei and mitochondria, in eukaryotes. This allows for more complex and efficient gene regulation processes, including transcriptional control through histone modification and chromatin remodeling. In contrast, prokaryotes lack these organelles and rely on simpler mechanisms, such as DNA-protein interactions, to regulate gene expression. Additionally, eukaryotic cells have a larger proportion of non-coding DNA (introns) compared to prokaryotes, which can affect gene regulation patterns.",0.618,0.646,0.631
35,Explain why the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells can be seen under a light microscope but those of prokaryotes cannot,"The prokaryote chromosome contains only coding regions and no extra non-coding DNA. Also, a prokaryote is a
 simple single cell with many less genes. Eukaryote cells are more complex with many more genes and much longer
 DNA that includes a lot of introns. The extra amount of DNA will only fit into a nucleus if it is tightly condensed and
 super-coiled around histone proteins. This packaging makes eukaryotic DNA large enough to be visible as thread-like
 linear chromosomes when stained and viewed under a light microscope. The single prokaryote chromosome does not
 pack tightly together and is only visible as a dark nucleoid region.","The chromosomes of eukaryotic cells can be seen under a light microscope because they have membrane-bound organelles, which allow for the formation of a clear image. In contrast, prokaryotes do not have these membrane-bound organelles, making it difficult to visualize their chromosomes using a light microscope.",0.641,0.568,0.602
36,Name the three types of RNA and outline their basic functions.,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries a copy of the nucleotide sequence of DNA that specifies the amino acid sequence for
 a protein. The mature mRNA travels from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it binds to ribosomes ready for translation.
 Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms a small organelle called a ribosome, which is the site at which the information in the
 mRNA is translated into a chain of amino acids.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules transfer amino acids from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes, where they are joined to
 form a polypeptide chain. The sequence of the chain is based on the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA.","There are three main types of RNA: Messenger RNA (mRNA), Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and Transfer RNA (tRNA). 

Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA in the nucleus to ribosomes in the cytoplasm, providing the instructions for protein synthesis. 

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes, responsible for making proteins. 

Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to the ribosome during translation, helping to build an amino acid chain and create a polypeptide (protein).",0.751,0.692,0.72
37,Identify the three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes.,"The three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes include: 
1. transcription which is the synthesis of mRNA
2. RNA processing, where the pre-mRNA is refined into mature mRNA
3. translation, as the polypeptide chain constructed at the ribosome from code on mature mRNA","The three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes are:

1. Transcription: The process by which the DNA sequence is copied into an mRNA molecule.
2. Translation: The process by which the mRNA molecule is read and translated into a polypeptide chain.

Note that these stages are not explicitly mentioned as ""stages"" in the provided documents, but they can be inferred from the descriptions of transcription and translation processes.",0.649,0.753,0.697
38,Outline the main structural features of eukaryotic genes and their functions.,"stop and start codons—regions at which encoding DNA begins and ends for a specific gene
 promoter regions—an upstream binding region for the enzyme that is involved in the encoding process
 (which is RNA polymerase)
 exons—DNA regions that are coding segments
 introns—DNA regions that are non-coding segments","The main structural features of eukaryotic genes include:

* A nucleus that stores genetic information and controls cell activities
* Mitochondria that produce cellular energy through cellular respiration
* Cell membrane that keeps cell contents contained and regulates what enters or exits the cell
* Cytoplasm, a semi-fluid substance that suspends organelles and is composed of water, ions, salts, and organic molecules like proteins
* Chloroplasts in plant cells that convert light energy into glucose through photosynthesis
* Vacuoles that store materials such as water, nutrients, and waste

These features enable eukaryotic cells to be more complex, compartmentalized, and efficient compared to prokaryotic cells.",0.417,0.472,0.443
39,"Proteins are key components of cells. Outline, with
 examples, at least five different roles carried out by
 proteins.","Proteins have various functions in cells/organisms. They act as enzymes to catalyse all biochemical reactions, form structural components of cells and organs, are involved in movement (e.g. as contractile fibres in cells), are embedded in cell and organelle membranes as well as being involved in the transport of materials across membranes. They are also involved in the transport of substances such as oxygen in red blood cells by bonding to haemoglobin protein, for signal transduction, cell recognition, communication (e.g. as hormones like oestrogen) or antibodies involved in immune defence.","Proteins play multiple roles in cells, including:

* Forming structural components in cells and tissues
* Providing important structural components of cell membranes
* Having functional roles, such as enzymes that control metabolic reactions or hormones that regulate cell functioning
* Occurring suspended in the protoplasm of cells or combining with other macromolecules to form an important structural part of all membranes within the cell.

Examples of proteins include enzymes, hormones, and hemoglobin.",0.653,0.605,0.628
40,Distinguish between the proteome and proteomics.,"A proteome is the complete set of proteins in an individual organism. Proteomics is the scientific study of the proteins, including the use of technologies that assist in studying and understanding proteins.","The proteome refers to the entire set of proteins produced by an organism, while proteomics is the study of these proteins and their functions. In other words, proteome is the ""what"" (the collection of proteins), and proteomics is the ""how"" and ""why"" (studying the properties, interactions, and functions of those proteins).",0.622,0.743,0.677
41,Compare fibrous and globular proteins,"Fibrous proteins are elongated with little or no tertiary folding, usually insoluble and have have structural roles like keratin in fingernails. Whilst globular proteins are compactly folded and coiled into spherical tertiary and quaternary structures, usually soluble such as enzymes and hormones are globular proteins.","Fibrous proteins and globular proteins differ in their structure and function. Fibrous proteins, such as collagen, tend to be long and string-like, providing structural support to cells, tissues, and organs. In contrast, globular proteins, like haemoglobin, are more compact and spherical, often playing functional roles such as transporting molecules or facilitating chemical reactions.",0.628,0.622,0.625
42,Explain what is meant by a protein becoming 'denatured'.,"A protein is said to be denatured when the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces that create the tertiary structure of the protein are broken and the shape of the protein is altered.","When a protein becomes ""denatured,"" it means that its natural shape or structure has been altered due to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals. This can lead to loss of function and is often irreversible. The protein's native shape is maintained by various chemical bonds, including hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and disulfide bridges. When these bonds are disrupted, the protein's shape collapses, leading to denaturation.",0.577,0.653,0.613
43,Outline the factors that can cause a protein to become denatured.,A protein is denatured when it is exposed to temperatures above its optimum temperature and sometimes when the protein is exposed to pH levels higher or lower than its optimum pH.,"The factors that can cause a protein to become denatured include changes in temperature, pH, and substrate concentration. Heat can cause the protein to unfold and lose its native shape, leading to permanent loss of function. Additionally, changes in pH can alter the shape of the protein by interacting with amino acids, causing the active site to change and disabling enzyme function.",0.528,0.605,0.564
44,Explain the difference between the genotype and phenotype of an individual.,A genotype is the combination of alleles that an individual has for the characteristic being investigated. The phenotype of the individual is the trait that a given genotype expresses. The environment also plays a role in the expression of the phenotype.,"The difference between genotype and phenotype is that genotype refers to an organism's entire genetic makeup, whereas phenotype refers to the traits and characteristics that are expressed as a result of this genetic information. In other words, an individual's genotype is their unique sequence of DNA, while their phenotype is the observable expression of that DNA. For example, someone may have a certain genotype for eye color, which could express as blue eyes. The environment can also influence an individual's phenotype, such as through nutrition or exposure to certain chemicals.",0.584,0.707,0.64
45,Describe an example where an organism's phenotype can be affected by the environment in which it is raised.,"An example answer is—Flower colour in hydrangeas is affected by the pH of the soil,
 which affects the availability of aluminium in the soil to the plant. Therefore, plants with the same genotype can have
 different colour phenotypes.","An example where an organism's phenotype can be affected by the environment in which it is raised is the development of resistance to disease. For instance, rabbits with myxoma virus developed physiological adaptations over time, allowing them to resist the disease. This adaptation was likely driven by environmental pressures, as the presence of the virus placed a selective pressure on the rabbit population, favoring those that were able to develop immunity. As a result, the rabbits' phenotype changed in response to their environment, enabling them to survive and reproduce more effectively.",0.541,0.601,0.569
46,What is meant by the term 'monohybrid cross'?,Monohybrid crosses are crosses between two individuals with different alleles at a single genetic locus. These crosses are performed to determine which trait is dominant.,"The term ""monohybrid cross"" is not directly mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on general knowledge, a monohybrid cross refers to a breeding experiment where two parents with different forms of a single gene are crossed to produce offspring that inherit one copy of each variant. This allows scientists to study the inheritance pattern and expression of a specific trait or characteristic.",0.572,0.716,0.636
47,What is the Law of Independent Assortment and what does it state?,"Mendel’s second law of inheritance, the Law of Independent Assortment, states that the alleles of a gene controlling one trait assort independently of alleles of another gene controlling a different trait.","The Law of Independent Assortment states that when two or more pairs of unrelated, contrasting characteristics are crossed, the different pairs of factors separate out independently of each other. This means that the genes for one characteristic do not necessarily get inherited together with the genes for another characteristic, even if they are located on the same chromosome.",0.605,0.684,0.642
48,What are the possible outcomes of meiosis in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb? List all the gametes that this individual could produce.,"The possible outcomes of meiosis (gametes) in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb (for unlinked genes, or linked genes after crossing over) are AB, Ab, aB, ab.","As a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb, meiosis can produce 8 possible gametes:

* Ab and ab (both carrying one dominant allele and one recessive allele)
* Ay and ay (with one or zero copies of the Y chromosome)

These gametes are formed through the random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I and independent assortment.",0.62,0.698,0.657
49,List one way in which population genetics is useful for conservation purposes,Population genetics can be used to measure and monitor genetic variation in a population; track invasive species; and discover and define new species.,"One way in which population genetics is useful for conservation purposes is by maintaining variation within populations to ensure they can cope with environmental change. By analyzing the frequencies of variants of alleles and how they change over time and space, scientists can identify populations that are at risk of extinction due to low genetic diversity and develop strategies to preserve genetic diversity. This information can be used to inform conservation decisions and help protect endangered species.",0.558,0.71,0.625
50,List three characteristics of an ideal genetic marker and explain why they are necessary in population genetic analyses.,"The genetic marker must (1) be polymorphic in the population of interest, or it will not contain any useful information; (2) be a neutral marker (i.e. not under selection) as the analytical models usually assume random distribution of alleles; (3) be affordable and relatively easy to work with, as most projects have a limited budget.","An ideal genetic marker should have three key characteristics: specificity, reliability, and relevance. Specifically, it should be able to accurately identify an individual's genotype or phenotype, making it essential in population genetic analyses. SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are a type of genetic marker that meet these criteria. They are common variations in DNA sequences, occurring at specific locations on chromosomes, and can be used to determine genetic relatedness, establish evolutionary relatedness, and even predict susceptibility to certain diseases or traits.",0.533,0.512,0.522
51,Define 'genetic testing'.,"Genetic testing is a medical test used to detect specific alleles, mutations, genotypes or karyotypes that are associated with heritable traits, diseases or predispositions to diseases.","Genetic testing is a process that involves the analysis of an individual's DNA to detect specific genetic mutations or variations. This can be used to diagnose and prevent inherited diseases, as well as determine relatedness in paternity tests or forensic science applications. The process typically involves amplifying DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then separating the resulting fragments by size through electrophoresis.",0.535,0.645,0.585
52,What are the three main m ethodologies used in genetic sequencing and profiling?,Molecular genetic testing; cytogenetic testing-karyotyping and molecular cytogenetic testing via fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH); biochemical genetic testing.,"The three main methodologies used in genetic sequencing and profiling are:

1. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) - a process that amplifies DNA strands by repeated cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension.
2. Electrophoresis - a technique that separates DNA fragments based on their size or charge, allowing scientists to visualize and analyze the sequence of bases.
3. Nanopore Technology - a method that uses tiny pores embedded in a membrane to read the sequence of bases as DNA is threaded through the pore.

These methodologies are essential tools for sequencing and profiling DNA, enabling the analysis of genetic information and its applications in various fields, including medicine, biological research, and forensic science.",0.441,0.521,0.478
53,What is an STR? List the steps for determining a DNA profile by STR analysis.,"An STR is a short tandem repeat. They are short repeat sequences of DNA scattered throughout the genome. 
To make a DNA profile: 
• extract DNA from a tissue sample 
• amplify the STRs using PCR (different primers for different STRs) 
• run the PCR products on a gel or capillary electrophoresis 
• compare the bands on a gel or the peaks on the graph.","An STR (Short Tandem Repeat) is a segment of DNA that is highly variable between individuals, making it useful for constructing unique DNA profiles. To determine a DNA profile by STR analysis, you can follow these steps:

1. Use PCR to amplify the STRs.
2. Run the amplified fragments on an electrophoresis gel to determine their sizes.

The patterns of bands on the gel create a DNA profile, which can be used to determine the number of repeats in each STR by referring to a DNA ladder.",0.671,0.72,0.695
54,What was the original goal of the Human Genome Project?,"The original goal was to determine the complete human genome, the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA
 molecule and the number of genes in one human individual.","The original goal of the Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international effort to decode the entire sequence of the human genome, which was completed in 2003. The project aimed to identify all 20,000 to 25,000 genes and understand their functions, as well as discover variations in the DNA sequence responsible for diseases and develop genome-based strategies for detection, diagnosis, and treatment.",0.557,0.659,0.603
55,List two reasons that genetic variation is important for the long-term survival of a gene pool.,"Genetic variation means that populations are more able to adapt to changes and challenges in the environment, because natural selection acts upon genetic variation. Genetic variation acts as a buffer against the accumulation of dangerous mutations, as it reduces the chances of inbreeding.","Two reasons genetic variation is important for the long-term survival of a gene pool are: (1) it provides the raw material for natural selection, allowing populations to adapt to changing environments and increasing their chances of survival; and (2) it enables the introduction of beneficial alleles into a population, which can enhance its ability to cope with change.",0.594,0.688,0.638
56,Why are frameshift mutations more significant than substitution point mutations?,A substitution mutation only alters one codon; a frameshift mutation alters every codon after the mutation.,"Frameshift mutations, which involve insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides, can be more significant than substitution point mutations because they can alter the reading frame of the DNA sequence. This means that all amino acids after the mutation site can change, potentially leading to a dysfunctional or non-functional protein. In contrast, substitution point mutations typically only affect one amino acid, and if the new amino acid has similar properties, the resulting protein may still be functional.",0.505,0.698,0.586
57,2 Explain why silent mutations are called 'silent'.,"Silent mutations are silent because they do not change the amino acid that they code for, and as such they have no functional change in terms of protein products.","Silent mutations are called ""silent"" because they do not cause a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein, despite being a change in the DNA code. This is because multiple codons can code for the same amino acid, so even if one or more nucleotides are altered, the resulting protein remains unchanged.",0.62,0.725,0.668
58,state which chromosome is affected and whether the chromosome is in excess or missing. a Down syndrome,chromosome 21; one additional copy (trisomy 21),"The chromosome affected in Down syndrome is chromosome 21. The abnormality occurs when an individual has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two, resulting in trisomy. This means that there is one extra copy of chromosome 21 present in every cell, which can lead to various physical and developmental abnormalities characteristic of Down syndrome.",0.434,0.656,0.523
59,What is a neoplasm?,A neoplasm is a mass of tissue formed by uncontrolled cell division.,"A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that forms a mass. It can be benign, potentially malignant, or malignant, with the latter being cancer. Neoplasms can occur in various parts of the body, including skin, organs, bones, and tissues. They can also spread to other areas through the blood and lymph systems, leading to uncontrolled cell division and invasion of nearby tissues.",0.534,0.851,0.656
60,Give two examples of each of the following: a sources of chemical mutagens b physical mutagens c biological mutagen,"a Sources of chemical mutagens—acceptable answers include mustard gas, ethidium bromide, chemicals contained in tobacco, outdoor air pollution, coffee, nuts, tomatoes, pineapples, herbs, spices, mushrooms, cadmium and arsenic. b Physical mutagens—acceptable answers include particle radiation: nuclear fission, nuclear fusion; high energy electromagnetic radiation (EMR): X-rays, gamma rays and high energy ultraviolet light. c Biological mutagens—acceptable answers include oncoviruses (direct or indirect) such as HTLV-1 and human papillomavirus (HPV) and transposable elements (TEs, transposons).","Here are two examples each of sources of chemical, physical, and biological mutagens:

**Chemical Mutagens:**

1. Heavy metals like mercury and cadmium
2. Metals that occur naturally in the environment

**Physical Mutagens:**

No specific examples provided in the documents, but I can answer based on general knowledge. Physical mutagens include radiation, such as cosmic radiation from the sun or radiation in rocks and soils.

**Biological Mutagens:**

1. Viruses, such as Microbes that insert their DNA into a cell
2. Fungi like Aspergillus flavus that produce carcinogenic toxins",0.552,0.564,0.558
61,Explain how proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes can cause cancer.,"Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell growth. When these genes are unregulated, cell growth increases, causing tumours/ cancers/neoplasms. Tumour-suppressor genes inhibit cell division. If these genes are damaged, cell division can go unregulated, causing tumours/cancers/neoplasms","Proto-oncogenes are genes that normally regulate cell growth and division. When they mutate, they can become oncogenes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and potentially forming a tumor. Tumor-suppressor genes, on the other hand, code for proteins that slow down or stop cell growth and division. When these genes are mutated, they can no longer perform their normal function, allowing cells to grow uncontrollably and increasing the risk of cancer.",0.625,0.668,0.646
62,Is the following statement true or false? Mutations to non-coding regions of ONA will not have an effect on the organism. Explain your answer.,False. These mutations interfere with the transcription process; a gene could become partially or entirely non-functional.,"The statement ""Mutations to non-coding regions of ONA will not have an effect on the organism"" is FALSE.

According to the provided documents, mutations in non-coding DNA can affect gene expression, which can cause changes to the organism. Some mutations may even lead to developmental and congenital abnormalities or a disposition to specific diseases. Non-coding DNA helps regulate the expression of coding sequences, including promoters that control transcription, and changes to these regions can have significant effects on the organism.",0.496,0.599,0.542
63,Describe the process by which intrans are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule during transcription.,"During the transcription process, the introns (which do not code for proteins) must be removed to create functional mRNA. The removal is known as splicing and requires a protein complex known as a spliceosome. The spliceosome is made up of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles or snRNPs. This spliceosome binds to three recognised sequences along the intron: one at the 5′ end (known as the 5′ junction) one at the 3′ end (the 3′ junction) and one near the 3′ end (the branch point) that allows the intron to fold into a loop before it is removed. After the intron is removed, the exons can join together to create an mRNA molecule with a neat, continuous coding sequence","During transcription, introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule through splicing, allowing only expressed sections (exons) to be joined and expressed as a protein.",0.692,0.53,0.6
64,What is a deep intronic mutation?,A deep intronic mutation is a mutation that is located more than 100 nucleotides from the 5′ or 3′ junctions between the intron and the exon.,"A deep intronic mutation refers to a type of mutation that occurs in an intron, which is a non-coding region of DNA. This type of mutation can affect RNA processing by disrupting the normal splicing of pre-mRNA into mature mRNA. In particular, a deep intronic mutation can cause incorrect splicing and lead to the inclusion of an intron as part of the translated protein sequence, resulting in a pseudo-exon. This can have significant effects on gene expression and may be linked to various diseases or developmental abnormalities.",0.543,0.628,0.583
65,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a germ cell? Give an example of each.,"Somatic cells are all the cells in the body of an organism, apart from the gametes (egg and sperm cells). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells","The difference between a somatic cell and a germ cell is that a somatic cell is any cell in the body except for sperm or egg cells, whereas a germ cell is a reproductive cell that can give rise to gametes (sperm or egg). Somatic cells are responsible for maintaining the functions of the body's tissues, while germ cells are specialized for reproduction. Examples of somatic cells include skin cells and muscle cells, while examples of germ cells include sperm and egg cells.",0.667,0.808,0.731
66,Explain how an error in meiosis can lead to Down syndrome.,"An error in meiosis is caused by non-disjunction of chromosomes/chromatids, where chromosomes/chromatids do not separate. Non-disjunction can occur between homologous chromosomes during anaphase I or between chromatids during anaphase II. Errors in meiosis occur during gamete (sperm or egg) formation. Down syndrome is due to an extra chromosome 21 where a gamete receives two copies of chromosome 21. As a result the zygote (offspring) has three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) instead of two and a total of 47 chromosomes instead of 46.","An error in meiosis can lead to Down syndrome through numerical abnormalities. During meiosis, chromosomes fail to separate properly, resulting in gametes with an extra or missing copy of a chromosome. In humans, trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This can be caused by non-disjunction during meiosis, where homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate properly.",0.713,0.668,0.69
67,Why is polyploidy more common in plants than animals?,"Polyploidy is more common in plants than animals because many plants can reproduce by asexual reproduction. For example, a triploid plant (3n) is typically sterile or has low fertility because of problems with chromosome pairing during meiosis and gamete formation. But it could survive by vegetative reproduction. Fewer complex animals can reproduce asexually, so polyploidy that results in sterility is less common.","Polyploidy is more common in plants than animals because it often leads to larger, stronger, and more resistant individuals that can reproduce normally. In contrast, polyploid animals are rare as they usually fail to develop or have reduced fertility. This is due to the fact that somatic mutations, which occur in body cells, are not passed on to offspring, whereas germ-line mutations, which occur in sex cells, can be passed on and increase the chance for evolution in populations.",0.621,0.658,0.639
68,Define the term 'biotechnology'.,"Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary technology, which uses biological processes and organisms to create new products and develop new technologies.","Biotechnology is the manipulation of living organisms or biological processes for human benefit. It involves the use of genetic techniques to study genetic phenomena and apply refined knowledge of biological processes to make efficient use of technologies. This field has evolved over time, from ancient biotechnology using trial-and-error methods without understanding biochemical processes, to modern biotechnology that utilizes knowledge of DNA and genetic manipulation to develop products such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and gene therapy.",0.562,0.726,0.634
69,Define the term 'selective breeding' and provide an example of its application in ancient times.,"Selective breeding is a process where the animals or plants that express desired characteristics are bred together to produce offspring that will also show these characteristics. Examples will vary but may include horses, which have been bred for different uses such as ploughing, racing and dressage.","Selective breeding is the process of creating organisms with desired characteristics by controlling their mating and reproduction. This can be achieved through natural breeding, artificial insemination, or artificial pollination.

In ancient times, selective breeding was applied to animals such as cattle, dogs, and sheep to produce desirable traits like improved milk production or stronger herds. For example, farmers may have bred cattle with exceptional milk-yielding abilities to produce offspring that inherited these characteristics, leading to increased dairy productivity.",0.609,0.654,0.631
70,Identify the significant scientific event that marked the commencement of modern biotechnology.,The discovery of DNA.,"The significant scientific event that marked the commencement of modern biotechnology is the discovery of recombinant DNA technology in 1973 by Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer. This breakthrough allowed scientists to manipulate genetic material using enzymes such as DNA ligase and restriction endonucleases, revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and paving the way for advancements in biotechnology.

(Note: I didn't use any specific document provided as it doesn't seem relevant to the question. Instead, I used general knowledge to answer the question.)",0.348,0.614,0.444
71,Describe the positive social impacts of the GM crop Golden Rice.,"Answers may vary but could include: improved health and nutrition to some of the poorest communities, reduced vitamin A deficiency in some of the poorest communities, the success of Golden Rice has promoted the development of further GM crops.","The positive social impacts of Golden Rice include addressing vitamin A deficiency, which can cause blindness and other serious health problems in developing countries. This technology has the potential to alleviate dietary deficiencies and improve the quality of life for millions of people, particularly in Asia and Africa where rice is a staple food. By introducing more vitamin A into the diet through genetic engineering, Golden Rice can help combat the estimated 500,000 cases of blindness and nearly 2 million deaths caused by vitamin A deficiency each year.",0.532,0.563,0.547
72,Explain why a religion or culture may oppose the use of transgenic animals.,"Some religions restrict certain foods. While a transgenic animal may appear to be of one species, it may contain some genetic elements of species, which members of different religious groups choose not to eat. Some cultures may also have ethical reasons for opposing the use of transgenic animals.","A religion or culture may oppose the use of transgenic animals due to concerns about tampering with the genome, humanising organisms, and violating human and animal rights. Additionally, some religious beliefs may view such interventions as going against natural processes or creating a ""superhuman"" generation through CRISPR, which could be perceived as morally questionable.",0.578,0.646,0.61
73,Describe how genetic variation can benefit agricultural biotechnology.,"Genetic variation improves the evolutionary potential of populations, species, cultivars and breeds of organisms. This improves their long-term stability and the potential to develop new plant cultivars and animal breeds.","Genetic variation can benefit agricultural biotechnology by allowing for the creation of crop plants that are resilient, easy to grow, pest- and pathogen-resistant, high-yielding, and higher in nutritional content. This can be achieved through various techniques such as gene editing, CRISPR, microinjection, or using natural bacterial vectors. The benefits of genetic technologies in agriculture include increased biodiversity, reduced need for pesticides, improved soil quality, and yield. Additionally, genetically modified crops can provide nutritionally enhanced foods to alleviate dietary deficiencies in developing countries.",0.509,0.572,0.539
74,Explain how the increased use of a species for biotechnology could cause biodiversity loss.,"If a species is increasingly used for biotechnology, its value rises. This could lead to overexploitation and endangerment of the species.","The increased use of a species for biotechnology can cause biodiversity loss in the long term. This is because selective breeding, DNA manipulation, and other genetic technologies often focus on introducing specific traits or characteristics into a population, which can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity. Additionally, the reliance on a single gene or characteristic can make the population more vulnerable to extinction if that trait is lost due to disease or environmental changes. Over time, this can result in a loss of biodiversity as populations become less resilient and more susceptible to threats.",0.559,0.671,0.61
75,Differentiate between in situ and ex situ conservation methods.,"In situ practices maintain the organism in its natural environment, whereas ex situ methods conserve organisms outside of their natural environment (e.g. in zoos).","Here's a concise answer:

In situ conservation methods involve preserving species and their habitats in their natural environments, whereas ex situ methods involve removing or relocating species or genetic material outside of their natural habitats. In situ conservation methods are often more effective for maintaining ecosystem services and promoting biodiversity, while ex situ methods can be useful for preserving specific species or genetic lines.",0.608,0.714,0.656
76,Define the term 'artificial insemination',Artificial insemination is a reproductive technology that involves the deliberate introduction of male sperm into the female reproductive tract by a method other than sexual intercourse.,"Artificial insemination is a reproductive technology that involves the injection of male semen into the vagina or cervix of a female without sexual intercourse. This technique is commonly used in agriculture, where semen is collected from a male specimen and then inserted into the cervix/uterus of a female using an inseminating rod/gun. The goal of artificial insemination is to produce offspring with desirable characteristics by selecting males and females that exhibit those traits.",0.605,0.801,0.689
77,What advantages does artificial insemination bring to agriculture?,"Answers may vary but could include: • multiple females can be impregnated from one sample • females in different geographic locations to the male can be impregnated • farmers don’t have to keep male animals on their property • avoids behavioural challenges associated with mating animals • reproductive health of population protected through screening of semen samples • requires no animal-to-animal contact, avoiding the spread of disease.","Artificial insemination brings several advantages to agriculture, including the ability to reproduce livestock with desirable characteristics, reduce transportation costs by breeding animals in different locations, and increase control over reproduction schedules. This technology also allows for the selection of males with specific traits, enabling farmers to produce offspring with improved qualities. Additionally, artificial insemination can help conserve genetic diversity by reducing the need for natural breeding and minimizing the risk of disease transmission between animals.",0.551,0.532,0.541
78,How does artificial insemination differ from in vitro fertilisation (IVF)?,Artificial insemination involves the delivery of semen directly into the female reproductive system. Whereas IVF removes the egg from the female and fertilises it with the sperm in a laboratory setting prior to returning the fertilised egg back into the female uterus.,"Artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization (IVF) are both reproductive technologies that aim to pass on desirable characteristics to the next generation. The main difference between the two is where the fertilization process takes place: artificial insemination involves inserting semen into a female's uterus, whereas IVF involves combining an egg and sperm outside the body, followed by incubation and potential implantation in a uterus.",0.623,0.701,0.66
79,What is artificial twinning? How does it differ from the birth of natural identical twins?,"Artificial twinning splits an embryo in two very early in the development process. Both halves of the embryo continue to divide leading to two separate individuals with identical genetic make-up. Artificial embryo twinning differs from natural identical twin development as it is carried out in a laboratory petri dish, with the early embryo artificially separated into individual cells and allowed to continue dividing. The embryos are then transferred into a surrogate mother.","Artificial twinning refers to the process of creating genetically identical twins in the laboratory, similar to the natural occurrence of identical twins. In this process, an embryo is allowed to divide and then split into individual cells, each of which can develop into a complete organism. This method mimics the natural process that leads to identical twins, where both split halves of the embryo develop into two separate, genetically identical individuals.

Compared to the birth of natural identical twins, artificial twinning involves controlled laboratory conditions and the manipulation of embryos at an early stage. Natural identical twins result from the fertilization of a single egg that has split in two, while artificial twinning involves intentionally splitting an embryo into individual cells. Both methods produce genetically identical offspring, but the timing and circumstances of their development differ significantly.",0.637,0.677,0.656
80,Explain the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer.,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves the removal of chromosomes from an egg cell and replaces them with the nucleus of a somatic cell taken from the organism being cloned. The egg cell is then induced to divide. Once the embryo has developed, it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate female organism. The individual that is born following gestation will be an identical genetic copy of the animal from which the original somatic cell was taken.","Based on the provided documents, I can explain the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) but it's not directly mentioned in the documents. However, the document discussing endocytosis and exocytosis provides relevant information.

Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a process where the nucleus from an adult cell is transferred into an egg cell that has had its own nucleus removed. The transferred nucleus then undergoes normal cellular processes, resulting in the formation of an embryo.

While the documents don't explicitly discuss SCNT, they do describe endocytosis and exocytosis, which involve the movement of substances across cell membranes. Endocytosis brings molecules into a cell by engulfing them with the cell membrane to form a vesicle, whereas exocytosis moves materials out of a cell by releasing the contents of a vesicle.

In SCNT, the nucleus from an adult cell is essentially ""imported"" into an egg cell through a process similar to endocytosis. The transferred nucleus then undergoes normal cellular processes, which can be thought of as the movement of genetic information into the egg cell.

Here's a concise response:

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) involves transferring the nucleus from an adult cell into an egg cell that has had its own nucleus removed. This process is similar to endocytosis, where substances are brought into a cell by engulfing them with the cell membrane. The transferred nucleus then undergoes normal cellular processes, resulting in the formation of an embryo.",0.529,0.64,0.579
81,Describe the term 'gene therapy'.,Gene therapy refers to the insertion of a gene into an individual’s cells to correct or replace defective gene function that leads to disease.,"Gene therapy is an experimental technique that uses genes to treat or prevent disease. It involves replacing, inactivating, or introducing new genes into the body to help fight a disease. There are two types of gene therapy: somatic and germline. Somatic gene therapy transfers DNA to cells that don't produce sperm or eggs, while germline gene therapy transfers DNA to cells that produce eggs or sperm, which can be passed on to children.",0.535,0.681,0.599
82,What types of human proteins are commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology?,"Human proteins commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology are hormones, enzymes, vaccines and cytokines.","Recombinant DNA technology enables the production of various human proteins. These include enzymes, membrane proteins, structural proteins such as those in the cytoskeleton, and functional proteins that perform specific roles like hormone components. The diversity of proteins produced by this technology arises from the 20 possible amino acid subunits linked into polypeptide chains under coded directions from DNA.",0.569,0.777,0.657
83,What is a plasmid? Describe the role played by plasmids in gene cloning.,"A plasmid is a circular molecule of bacterial DNA. Plasmids are useful in gene cloning. They replicate frequently within the bacterial cell. When a foreign gene such as the human insulin gene is inserted into bacterial plasmids and the bacteria are cultured, large amounts of the protein (insulin) can be produced by the bacteria.","A plasmid is a circular piece of DNA isolated from bacteria that plays a crucial role in gene cloning. In the process of gene cloning, a plasmid vector is isolated from a bacterial cell and treated with the same restriction enzyme as the target gene. The target gene is then cut by the restriction enzyme to create 'sticky ends', which are complementary to the sticky ends of the plasmid. These sticky ends attach to each other through base-pairing, and DNA ligase bonds them together (annealing). This new recombinant plasmid is then introduced into a bacterial cell, allowing gene cloning to occur as the bacterium reproduces and expresses many copies of the target gene, producing more of the target protein.",0.623,0.72,0.668
84,Describe a genetically modified organism and compare it to a transgenic organism.,"A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism that has an alteration to one or more genes due to gene transfer, mutagenesis or gene editing. Transgenic organisms are a subset of GMOs; they have a gene from a different source inserted into their genome (e.g. a plant with a bacterial insecticide gene, a mouse with a human antibody gene, or a goat with a spider silk protein gene).","A genetically modified organism (GMO) is the product of genetic engineering, where a living organism's genome is modified to introduce new traits. A transgenic organism, on the other hand, is a type of GMO that has been modified to contain genes from another species. In other words, all transgenic organisms are GMOs, but not all GMOs are necessarily transgenic organisms.",0.661,0.597,0.627
85,Identify two advantages of artificial insemination for human fertility treatment,Artificial insemination is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive procedure.,"Two advantages of artificial insemination for human fertility treatment are the passing of desirable characteristics and increased control over reproduction. By selecting a male with desired traits and inserting his semen into a female, the chances of successful pregnancies increase, allowing for better control over the reproduction process. This technology also enables the reproduction of livestock that is geographically distant, making it possible to breed animals with desirable traits regardless of their location.",0.432,0.606,0.504
86,Define the term 'xenotransplantation'.,"Xenotransplantation involves the transplantation of cells, tissues or organs from a donor species to a different species (e.g. from a non-human donor species to a human).","The term ""xenotransplantation"" is not explicitly defined in the provided documents. However, based on the information about cloning, gene transfer, and somatic cell nuclear transfer, I can infer that xenotransplantation refers to the process of transferring genetic material or cells from one species (the donor) to another species (the recipient), which results in a genetically identical copy of the original organism. This concept is also illustrated in the document about breeding Dolly the sheep using udder tissue as the somatic cell, where an animal's DNA is transferred into an egg cell to create a genetically identical copy.",0.512,0.694,0.589
87,Provide an example of a therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology in medicine.,Answers may vary but could include: • epidermal growth factor used in the treatment of burns to improve the survival of skin grafts • interleukin-2 used in cancer treatment • antibodies for immunotherapy • vaccines against a number of viruses.,"A therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology in medicine is gene therapy, which involves inserting a gene into an individual's cells to correct or replace a defective gene function that leads to disease. This technology has been used to treat genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, and can also be applied to develop methods for earlier disease detection and treatment.",0.486,0.481,0.484
88,Outline the chain of infection.,infectious agent → reservoir → portal of exit → mode of transmission → portal of entry → susceptible host,"The chain of infection consists of three elements: a susceptible host, a pathogen capable of causing disease, and a mode of transmission. The mode of transmission can be direct contact, indirect contact, or vector transmission.

Direct contact occurs when the host and another organism come into physical contact with each other. Indirect contact involves no direct contact between hosts, but rather relies on an intermediate factor such as air, water, or vectors like mosquitoes or ticks. Vector transmission requires a vector to transmit the disease from one host to another.

In summary, the chain of infection includes:

1. A susceptible host that is prone to contracting the disease
2. A pathogen capable of causing the disease
3. A mode of transmission (direct contact, indirect contact, or vector transmission) that allows the pathogen to spread from the infected host to a new host",0.405,0.532,0.46
89,Name three portals of exit in human hosts,"Respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract or skin","Based on the provided documents, three portals of exit in human hosts are:

1. Direct contact: This involves direct physical contact with an infected individual or contaminated surface.
2. Indirect transmission: This includes the spread of disease through the air, dust, and vectors such as mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, and flies.
3. Vector-borne transmission: This refers to the transmission of disease through vectors like mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, and flies that carry pathogens.",0.322,0.394,0.354
90,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in a population of an area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.","Here's a complete and concise response to the user's query:

An epidemic is an outbreak of an infectious disease that spreads rapidly among individuals in a defined area or population at the same time, whereas a pandemic is typically the spread of a new disease across a continent or even worldwide. In other words, an epidemic occurs within a specific geographic area, while a pandemic spreads globally.",0.598,0.689,0.64
91,Compare germ theory to the theory of spontaneous generation.,Germ theory replaced spontaneous generation as the explanation for the occurrence and transmission of disease. Spontaneous generation states that life can arise from non-living matter while germ theory states that life comes from existing living matter.,"Here's a concise response to compare germ theory with the theory of spontaneous generation:

Germ theory proposes that all living organisms arise from the reproduction of existing organisms, whereas the theory of spontaneous generation suggests that life can emerge from non-living matter without the need for parental influence. Germ theory is supported by evidence such as biochemical similarities and the presence of transitional forms in fossil records, while the theory of spontaneous generation has been largely discredited due to a lack of empirical evidence.",0.591,0.765,0.667
92,What are Koch's four postulates?,"1 The microorganism must be present in the tissues of the infected organism and not in a healthy organism. 2 The microorganism must be able to be cultivated in isolation from the infected organism. 3 When an uninfected organism is then inoculated with the culture, it should develop symptoms of the disease. 4 Samples from the second infected organism should be able to be isolated and found to be the same as the microorganism from the first infected organism.","Koch's postulates are not mentioned in the provided documents. However, I can provide information on Koch's four postulates, which are a set of criteria used to establish the causal relationship between a microorganism and a specific disease.

Koch's four postulates are:

1. The microorganism must be found in all cases of the disease.
2. The microorganism must not be found in healthy individuals.
3. The microorganism must be isolated from the host and grown in culture.
4. The microorganism must cause the same disease when introduced into a healthy individual.

These postulates were first proposed by Robert Koch in 1882 and have since been widely used to establish the causative agent of many infectious diseases.",0.583,0.668,0.623
93,Explain one limitation of Koch's postulates.,answers should include either: asymptomatic carriers do not meet postulate 1; pathogens such as viruses that cannot be cultured and so do not meet postulates 2 and 3.,"One limitation of Koch's postulates is that they require the causative agent to be able to be isolated and grown in pure culture, which can be difficult for some microbes such as viruses and prions. Additionally, the method does not account for pathogens with complex lifestyles that may not re-infect after being cultured.",0.527,0.547,0.537
94,Give two examples of pathogens that cause disease in plants,"Student answers may vary. The following are some examples: Phytophthora infestans, which causes potato blight; Fusarium oxysporum, the cause of Panama disease; Phytophthora cinnamomi, the cause of root rot or dieback disease.","Based on the provided documents, two examples of pathogens that cause disease in plants are:

* Fungal pathogens: These can cause diseases such as rust or soft rot, which involve the growth of fungi into and feeding on dead plant tissue.
* Viral pathogens: Viroids, for example, are non-cellular pathogens that compete with plant cells for nucleotides, causing damage and disrupting internal structures.

Note that these documents primarily focus on the biology of pathogens and diseases in general, rather than specifically addressing plant diseases. However, they do provide relevant information that can be applied to understanding plant pathogenesis.",0.465,0.483,0.474
95,What is a zoonotic disease? Give an example of this type of disease.,"A zoonotic disease is a disease that has passed from an animal host to a human. An example is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, which can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).","A zoonotic disease is a type of infectious disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. An example of this type of disease is rabies, which is typically spread through the bites or scratches of infected animals such as dogs, bats, and raccoons.",0.666,0.625,0.645
96,Describe antigenic variation. What is the purpose of this adaptation in pathogens?,"Antigenic variation is the ability of pathogens to change their antigens (molecules on cells/pathogen surface that can induce an immune response in the host). Antigenic variation allows the pathogen to avoid recognition by the host’s immune system upon secondary exposure, giving the pathogen more time to colonise its host","Antigenic variation is a process by which pathogens evade the immune system's recognition by changing their surface antigens. This adaptation allows them to survive and reproduce, ensuring their survival and spread. The purpose of this adaptation is to enable pathogens to persistently infect hosts, allowing them to transmit disease and maintain their populations over time.",0.673,0.694,0.683
97,Briefly describe how HIV overcomes the host's immune response.,HIV uses the host’s T lymphocytes which direct coordination of the immune response. HIV has a protein on its surface that binds to receptors on T lymphocytes and hijacks those cells to make replicates of the virus.,"HIV overcomes the host's immune response by targeting T-helper lymphocytes, which are crucial for communication between B and T-killer lymphocytes. This disruption weakens the immune system, making the host susceptible to other infections. The virus also impairs the primary immune response, allowing it to transmit undetected to others. Additionally, HIV evades the immune system's detection by adapting to evade the human immune response, enabling it to persist and cause disease over time.",0.625,0.684,0.653
98,How does sneezing advance transmission of pathogens?,Some pathogens have adaptations that cause the host to produce extra mucus and cause discomfort resulting in sneezing. Sneezing can spread pathogens much faster and further to susceptible hosts than through direct skin-to-skin contact.,"According to the provided documents, sneezing can advance transmission of pathogens by allowing aerosols produced while coughing or sneezing to remain suspended in air, potentially infecting a non-infected individual. Additionally, sneezing and coughing can also transfer pathogens through direct contact with others, further increasing the risk of transmission.",0.59,0.612,0.601
99,Distinguish between disease caused by viruses and those caused by bacteria.,Viral pathogens rely on their viral envelope and capsid to penetrate host cells. Once a virus infects a host plant it can either result in a localised infection or it can move apoplastically or symplastically through the plant to become a systemic infection. Bacteria enter host plants via the stomata or other small wounds/openings. Once they have infected the plant they can move apoplastically to travel around the plant.,"Here's the answer:

Diseases caused by viruses and bacteria have distinct differences. Viruses are small capsules of protein containing DNA or RNA that can cause disease, whereas bacteria are single-celled organisms that can also cause illness. Viruses typically enter host cells and replicate inside them, while bacteria can thrive outside of cells and multiply rapidly.",0.547,0.541,0.544
100,Determine how you would distinguish between a healthy and a diseased plant,"Observing the colour and appearance of a plant is essential to determining whether the plant is healthy or unhealthy. Healthy plants typically exhibit stems which are straight and not wilted, leaves which are of a dark green colour and not discoloured or misshapen. Flowers of healthy plants are brightly coloured and plentiful. Healthy plants do not have lesions or other abnormal growths and may have multiple stems which are thicker. Unhealthy plants on the other hand exhibit discolouration in leaves and stems and flowers are not present or are very few. Plants that are suffering from disease may also exhibit wilting, dieback and organ deformities (leaf curling and excessive growths) especially when infections produce galls and other lesions.","To distinguish between a healthy and diseased plant, one can observe the symptoms caused by the pathogen. A healthy plant typically exhibits normal growth patterns, with leaves that are green and free of spots or deformities. In contrast, a diseased plant may display yellow or orange spots on its leaves, stunted growth, and death of leaves.

Additionally, a diseased plant may produce antimicrobial peptides as an adaptation to fight off the pathogen. This can be observed through the production of antimicrobial compounds that help isolate the pathogen and prevent its spread within the plant.

Furthermore, the presence of physical barriers such as cell walls containing lignin and cellulose, waxy epidermal cuticles, bark, and stomata can also be indicators of a healthy or diseased plant. A healthy plant may have open stomata, while a diseased plant may have closed or restricted stomata.

It is also important to consider the type of pathogen involved, such as fungal, viral, or bacterial pathogens, which can cause different symptoms and adaptations in the plant.",0.591,0.631,0.611
101,List at least three physical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals,The physical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry are: • skin—which prevents entry of pathogens into the body • cilia—help to move mucus and other debris into the stomach or out of the body • peristalsis—aids in the movement of secretions (mucus) or foreign invaders to the stomach to kill pathogenic organisms.,"Three physical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals include:

1. Skin: A large physical barrier that protects cells from pathogens, making it difficult for bacteria to break down through sweat produced by sweat glands.
2. Mucous Membranes: Found on the surface of respiratory and digestive tracts, mucous membranes trap pathogens and contain enzymes to break them down.
3. Cilia: Tiny structures located in the respiratory tract that cause mucus containing trapped pathogens to be coughed or sneezed up.

These physical barriers work together to provide a first line of defense against pathogen entry into animals.",0.601,0.656,0.627
102,List at least three chemical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals.,"The chemical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry into an animal are typically bodily secretions such as: • mucus—a sticky substance that traps pathogens and other foreign matter that enters the body • sebum—an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands that make the skin slightly acidic to prevent pathogenic organisms from growing on the skin and entering the body • cerumen—an oily waxy substance produced by the glands in the ear canal that helps to trap foreign substances and pathogens • acidic secretions (stomach, urogenital)—provide an acidic environment which pathogens are unable to tolerate and aid in the destruction of pathogenic organisms • lacrimal secretions—produced by the tear ducts they contain enzymes and other substances that break down bacterial cell walls and prevent infection by washing away debris and other foreign matter • lysozymes—enzymes found in secretions such as saliva, mucus and tears. This enzyme breaks down bacterial cell walls","Based on the provided documents, three chemical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals are:

* Lysozyme: an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls, killing them and helping to fight infection.
* Acidic secretions: containing degradative enzymes like lysozyme, these secretions have a low pH that chemically screens out pathogens.
* Microbiological barriers: the presence of microflora in various parts of the body, which compete for space and nutrients, making it difficult for pathogens to establish themselves.",0.64,0.605,0.622
103,How are microflora necessary for the health of an animal?,"Microflora are beneficial bacteria that inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, throat, lower part of the gastrointestinal tract and the urogenital tract in healthy individuals. Microflora plays an important role in keeping pathogenic organisms from inhabiting an animal. The presence of microflora prevents the growth and colonisation of other bacteria because microflora compete with pathogenic bacteria for space and resources, and produce chemicals that reduce the pH of the micro-environment.","Microflora are essential for an animal's health because they play a crucial role in maintaining a balance within the animal's ecosystem. In fact, research has shown that fungi, in particular, can thrive on the skin surface of animals and even release mycotoxins that cause disease, such as athlete's foot. Additionally, microflora can also influence an animal's immune system by producing proteins that reduce the host's response to infection, making it harder for the animal to fight off diseases.",0.601,0.622,0.611
104,Outline the main components of the innate immune system,"The main components of the innate immune system are a number of specialised types of white blood cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells), a number of proteins and enzymes (e.g. lysozymes, cytokines, and complement proteins), inflammatory responses (involving histamines and prostaglandins), and apoptosis (programmed cell death).","The main components of the innate immune system include:

* Physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes
* Defence cells like phagocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and complement system
* Various substances like cytokines and antimicrobial proteins
* Complement system, a series of soluble proteins that activate one another to support defence mechanisms

These components work together to prevent the entry of pathogens into the body, destroy any pathogens that enter the body, and trigger inflammation and fever if necessary.",0.598,0.655,0.626
105,Phagocytes are important cells of the innate immune system. What is the function of some phagocytes that links the innate and adaptive immune systems?,"Some phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes. It is this antigen presentation that links the innate and adaptive immune systems.","Some phagocytes, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, play a crucial role in linking the innate immune system to the adaptive immune response. These cells can engulf foreign substances, break them down, and present fragments of antigens on their surface to T-cells, triggering an adaptive immune response. This process helps to activate other white blood cells, such as T-cells, to specifically target and eliminate the invading pathogen.",0.643,0.778,0.704
106,Distinguish between neutrophils and macrophages.,"This information may be presented in a table and diagrams drawn for further distinguishable features of both cells. Neutrophils are one of the most abundant white blood cells and a type of phagocyte. They can be distinguished by vesicles within their cytoplasm, which contain antimicrobial proteins to destroy pathogenic organisms. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and may live for a few hours. Macrophages on the other hand are matured monocytes. Macrophages work by ingesting pathogens in a phagosome. The cell membrane of the macrophage then binds with a lysosome (containing digestive enzymes) that dissolves the contents of the phagosome. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells and aid in the recognition of an invader by initiating T and B lymphocytes to be released. Macrophages may live for several months engulfing pathogenic organisms.","Neutrophils and macrophages are two types of white blood cells that play important roles in the immune system. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell in the bloodstream, functioning as phagocytes that engulf and destroy bacteria. They also produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to prevent further spread of pathogens. In contrast, macrophages are larger cells that mature from monocytes after entering tissues in response to infection. Macrophages and dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs), participating in acquired immunity by engulfing and processing foreign antigens.

In summary, neutrophils are primarily involved in phagocytosis and NET production, while macrophages play a key role in antigen presentation and acquired immunity.",0.678,0.619,0.647
107,Which MHC class interacts with helper T lymphocytes. and which interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes?,MHC-II interacts with helper T lymphocytes and MHC-I interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes,"According to the provided documents, MHC class II interacts with helper T lymphocytes. This is because MHC class II molecules are found on antigens presented by macrophages and other immune cells, which allows helper T cells to recognize non-self-antigens and initiate the immune response.

MHC class I, on the other hand, interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells). Cytotoxic T cells use their surface receptor to recognize MHC class I molecules complexed with antigens from infected cells, leading to the destruction of these infected cells.",0.556,0.836,0.668
108,Identify the different types of T lymphocytes and their functions.,"T lymphocyte Function helper T lymphocytes activate in recognition to an antigen presented by a phagocyte (macrophage) prompt T lymphocytes to release cytokines and stimulate B lymphocytes to differentiate into plasma cells which multiply and secrete antibodies and memory B lymphocytes as a response stimulate the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cause macrophages to phagocytose more rapidly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (killer T cells) recognise and kill foreign, infected or abnormal host cells by releasing toxic compounds destroy the body cell by deteriorating its cell membrane or injecting enzymes that will kill the cell and prevent the pathogen from infecting any further suppressor T lymphocytes turn off the immune response once the antigen has been successfully contained, destroyed or removed memory T lymphocytes remain in the body (in the lymphatic system) ready to mobilise if reinfected with the same pathogen able to quickly proliferate (divide) into effector T cells to","There are several types of T lymphocytes, each with distinct functions. The main types include:

* Cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells): These cells detect and destroy infected cells or tumor cells that display antigens on their surface.
* Helper T cells: These cells assist other immune cells, such as B cells, in their immunological processes by releasing cytokines to stimulate their activation.
* Memory T cells: These cells remain in the body and quickly respond to future invasions by the same antigen, providing long-term immunity.
* Suppressor T cells: These cells stop the immune response when the infection has been defeated, preventing unnecessary damage to healthy tissues.

These different types of T cells work together to provide specific functions that help protect the body against infections and diseases.",0.591,0.63,0.61
109,Explain why the lymphatic system is an important part of the adaptive immune response.,"The lymphatic system is an important part of the immune response generally because it is involved in the transport of immune cells throughout the body, and of adaptive immune responses specifically, because secondary lymphoid tissues are sites where antigen-presenting cells present antigens to lymphocytes, activating them and stimulating an adaptive immune response.","The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. It helps to rid the body of toxins, waste, and other unwanted materials, allowing the immune system to focus on responding to pathogens. The lymphatic system also helps to transport immune cells, such as T cells and B cells, throughout the body, ensuring that they can reach areas where they are needed most. Additionally, the lymphatic system is responsible for storing pre-made immune cells, including memory cells, which allow the immune system to ""remember"" specific pathogens and respond more quickly if re-exposed.",0.639,0.698,0.667
110,Define ' immunity'.,"The ability of a body or organism to recognise foreign substances, stimulate immune cells and kill and destroy the pathogen or foreign matter is known as immunity.","Immunity refers to the body's ability to recognize and respond to antigens, which are molecules that trigger an immune response. This response can be specific or non-specific, and it involves the production of antibodies and memory cells that help protect against future infections. There are different types of immunity, including active and passive immunity, as well as acquired and natural immunity.",0.53,0.63,0.576
111,Describe the process of phagocytosis.,"Phagocytosis is the process by which phagocytes (e.g. macrophages) engulf other cells or particles—particularly foreign matter or pathogens. First, the phagocyte recognises the antigen of the pathogen as foreign and engulfs it. The cell membrane then forms a vacuole (called a phagosome) around it. Next, a lysosome, containing digestive enzymes, fuses with the phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. The digestive enzymes break down the pathogen and the antigen fragments are presented on the surface of the phagocyte by MHC-II molecules. The leftover fragments are then released from the cell by exocytosis.","Phagocytosis is a process in which certain white blood cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, engulf and digest foreign substances like bacteria or other pathogens. This occurs through endocytosis, where the phagocyte changes its shape to form a vesicle around the target particle. The vesicle then fuses with a lysosome, allowing enzymes to break down the ingested material.",0.73,0.692,0.71
112,Distinguish between antibodies and antigens.,"Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are produced by B lymphocytes and released into the blood and lymph. Antibodies are proteins that bind to specific antigen molecules. The basic unit of an antibody molecule is a Y-shaped protein, formed by four polypeptide chains—two long heavy chains and two short light chains. Antibodies interfere with the function of the pathogen in a number of ways, including neutralising bacterial toxins, binding to antigens and activating phagocytes, and binding with soluble antigens causing them to precipitate out of solution. Antigens are unique molecules or parts of molecules that can be recognised by T lymphocytes or by antibodies produced by B lymphocytes. Antigens may be toxins, foreign substances, pathogens or parts of a pathogen that allow the body to recognise potentially harmful substances foreign to a body and mount an immune response against them. There are two main types of antigens: foreign antigens (heteroantigens) and non-foreign antigens (autoantigens). Antibodies induce an immune response to produce antibodies.","Antibodies and antigens are two important components of the immune system. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped proteins produced by B cells in response to an invading pathogen. They have a specific binding site that recognizes and binds to a particular antigen, which is a molecule found on the surface of pathogens or foreign substances. Antigens can be made up of protein or polysaccharides and have regions called epitopes that are recognized by specific lymphocytes. When an antibody binds to an antigen, it forms an antigen-antibody complex that can neutralize or remove the pathogen from the body.",0.704,0.649,0.675
113,What is meant by the term 'emerging infectious disease'?,"Emerging infectious diseases are either new or previously unrecognised diseases; diseases that have increased in incidence, virulence or geographic range; or diseases that may increase in the near future","An emerging infectious disease is an illness caused by a previously unknown or unfamiliar pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, or other microorganism. It can spread rapidly and unpredictably, often in areas with poor sanitation, inadequate healthcare systems, or where populations are vulnerable due to malnutrition, poverty, or lack of access to healthcare.",0.504,0.555,0.528
114,How can an organism become pathogenic and cause disease?,"New diseases emerge because of mutations in a pathogen, as well as when pathogens are exposed to a selection pressure (e.g. a drug) or adapt to a new host. Mutations may enable a pathogen to move to a new host. New mutations may increase the virulence, that is the ability of the pathogen to move into a wider range of hosts.","For an organism to become pathogenic and cause disease, it must enter the host, multiply in host tissues, overcome or bypass host defense mechanisms, and damage the host. Adaptations such as adhesion, invasion, neutralization, and transmission routes help facilitate this process. Pathogens can include viruses, bacteria, protozoans, fungi, prions, and viroids, each with unique features and mechanisms for causing disease.",0.528,0.547,0.537
115,Identify three human behaviours that can facilitate the spread of infectious disease.,"Answers may include: human-to-human contact, sexual activity, medical procedures.","Based on the provided documents, three human behaviors that can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases are:

1. Poor sanitation habits: This increases the spread of diseases, especially after natural disasters.
2. Overcrowding: This increases host-to-host transmission, making it easier for pathogens to spread.
3. Direct contact: Physical contact between people by touching, mixing of bodily fluids, etc. can spread diseases.

These behaviors are mentioned in the documents as factors that affect the spread of infectious diseases.",0.409,0.597,0.485
116,Name six procedures that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious disease.,1 hygiene practices 2 quarantine 3 vaccination 4 public health campaigns 5 use of pesticides 6 genetic engineering,"Here are six procedures that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious disease:

1. Hygiene practices, including hand washing after using the bathroom, showing frequently, and covering your mouth when coughing.
2. Quarantine: isolating individuals who are infected or suspected of being infected to prevent them from spreading the disease to others.
3. Vaccination, which provides active immunity against certain diseases.
4. Public health campaigns, which raise awareness about the importance of hygiene practices and vaccination in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.
5. Use of pesticides: while this method is not directly related to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, it can help control disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks that can transmit diseases.
6. Genetic engineering: this method has the potential to create disease-resistant plants and silence genes in targeted pathogens, thereby reducing the risk of transmission.

These procedures are important tools in controlling the spread of infectious diseases and protecting public health.",0.417,0.703,0.524
117,Explain the difference between active and passive immunity.,"Active immunity involves an individual’s own adaptive immune response. It takes time to develop, but the immunological memory that results can last for many years, even a lifetime. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies produced by another organism. This type of immunity is immediate, but will only protect the recipient for a few weeks or months because it does not result in immunological memory.","The difference between active and passive immunity lies in how substances move across a cell membrane. Passive immunity, also known as facilitated diffusion, allows molecules to move through the membrane without using cellular energy, whereas active transport uses ATP or electrochemical gradients to move substances against their concentration gradient. In other words, passive immunity is a slow but natural process that balances particles within the cell, while active transport enables cells to accumulate high concentrations of certain molecules like ions and sugars.",0.536,0.542,0.539
118,Provide an example of a public health crisis in Australia caused by infectious disease and describe the public health campaign.,"An example answer is: In July 1998 the Greater Western Sydney water supply was infected by high concentrations of the parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. An immediate public health campaign was launched. It included educating the public about the parasites and possible causes of water supply contamination as well as informing the public about the resulting treatment of the water supply. Information was disseminated through the media, schools and community organisations, as well as any locations where contact with contaminated water was likely (such as public pools and water fountains).","One example of a public health crisis in Australia caused by an infectious disease is the North Australian quarantine system. This system was put in place to prevent the spread of pests and diseases that could enter Australia through the northern region.

A public health campaign was launched to educate people on how to limit the spread of these diseases. The campaign included government regulations, regular screening, immunization programs, and public education.",0.62,0.571,0.595
119,Explain how antiseptics and disinfectants differ from antibiotics.,"Disinfectants are used to kill pathogens on surfaces. Antiseptics are used to kill pathogens on the body. They are nonspecific chemicals, killing or inactivating most viruses, bacteria and fungi. Antibiotics are used in the body and are specific for a group of bacteria","Antiseptics and disinfectants differ from antibiotics in their target and mode of action. Antiseptics and disinfectants work on the surface level, targeting bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms to prevent infection or kill them. They do not penetrate cells and are effective against a wide range of microorganisms. Antibiotics, on the other hand, work internally at the cellular level by interfering with the bacterial cell wall, ribosome, DNA synthesis, or other metabolic pathways, ultimately leading to cell death.",0.579,0.656,0.615
120,List some ways in which antiviral drugs may limit the spread of a virus.,"Antiviral drugs can work by: • preventing the virus from entering the cell, by binding to receptors that allow the virus to enter • inhibiting enzymes that catalyse reproduction of the virus genome • inhibiting reverse transcriptase (for retroviruses) • blocking transcription and translation of viral proteins • preventing the viruses from leaving the cell, so they cannot infect other cells.","Antiviral drugs can limit the spread of a virus by interfering with its development inside infected cells, slowing down the progress of the disease, and allowing the body's natural defenses to take over. They can also prevent the virus from entering or leaving cells, inhibiting enzymes that aid in viral replication, blocking transcription and translation of viral proteins, and preventing the virus from escaping from one cell to infect neighboring cells. By taking antiviral medication early in the course of the disease, individuals with higher risk of complications, such as those over 65, can benefit from these treatments.",0.649,0.719,0.682
121,How does antibiotic resistance arise and spread through bacterial populations?,Antibiotic resistance genes may already be present in the genome. They originate by mutation and can be passed to offspring in cell replication—all cells in a clone or colony of bacteria will have the resistance genes. They can be spread between bacteria by horizontal gene transfer—transferring plasmids that have resistance genes.,"Antibiotic resistance arises through genetic variations within bacterial populations, which allows some bacteria to survive and reproduce despite the presence of antibiotics. This process is driven by natural selection, where bacteria that develop resistance to antibiotics have a survival advantage over those that do not. As a result, resistant bacteria are more likely to be transmitted and spread throughout the population, making it challenging to treat bacterial infections with antibiotics.",0.56,0.578,0.569
122,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease, above what is normally expected in that population in that area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.","An epidemic refers to an outbreak of an infectious disease that spreads rapidly among individuals in a defined area or population at the same time. On the other hand, a pandemic is typically the spread of a new disease across a continent or even worldwide. In essence, an epidemic is localized, whereas a pandemic is global.",0.675,0.696,0.685
123,Describe herd immunity.,"Herd immunity is when a large number of people in a population are immune to a pathogen, reducing the chance of it successfully spreading through that population.","Herd immunity occurs when a high proportion of a population has been immunized against a specific disease, thereby reducing the spread and transmission of the disease. This phenomenon is characterized by the protection not only of the vaccinated individuals but also of those who are unvaccinated or have no immunity to the disease.",0.601,0.742,0.664
124,Differentiate between the incidence and prevalence of a disease.,"The incidence of disease is the rate of occurrence of new cases, indicating the risk of contracting the disease. The prevalence of disease measures the proportion of cases in the population at a given time, indicating how widespread the disease is.","Here's a concise and complete response to your question:

The incidence of a disease refers to the rate of new cases occurring within a specific period, indicating the risk of people contracting the disease. For example, an annual rate of 0.4 per 100,000 population.

On the other hand, prevalence measures the proportion of cases in the population at a given time, indicating the spread of the disease. For instance, on January 1st, 2017, out of 10,000 people in Town A, 40 have measles, which is an example of prevalence.

In summary, incidence focuses on new cases over a period, while prevalence looks at the proportion of cases in the population at a specific time.",0.59,0.839,0.693
125,Provide two reasons why knowledge of Indigenous Australian bush medicine remains limited.,"Two example answers are: (1) Traditional Indigenous Australian knowledge is shared through oral tradition, as well as singing and dancing ceremonies rather than recorded in writing. (2) Little research has been conducted on Indigenous Australian bush medicine and healing practices.","Two reasons why knowledge of Indigenous Australian bush medicine remains limited are the lack of written records and documentation, with most knowledge being shared through song, dance, and spoken word, making it challenging to recognize and protect intellectual property rights. Additionally, the vastness and complexity of this knowledge, developed over thousands of years, can be difficult to fully understand and preserve for future generations.",0.546,0.617,0.579
126,Identify some traditional roles of Indigenous Australian healers in bush medicine.,"Diagnosing, advising, reassuring and performing healing treatments.","Traditional roles of Indigenous Australian healers in bush medicine include the use of crushed tea-tree leaves to treat wounds and sore throats. They also used emu bush leaves to make a wash for sores, colds, headaches, diarrhoea, and chest pains. Additionally, gumbi gumbi was used as a compress to induce milk flow in new mothers or to treat eczema by grinding the oily seed into a paste and rubbing it onto the body. These practices have been passed down through generations and are still relevant today, with many modern products developed using traditional knowledge of bush medicine.",0.332,0.448,0.382
127,How do organisms exchange heat with their environment?,"Conduction occurs when the temperature of the organism and the environment are different. Heat exchange is a result of direct contact (e.g. a lizard basking on a warm rock). Convection is the transmission of heat from a warmer region to a colder region, resulting from the movement of liquid or gas (e.g. heat moves from the inside of living organisms to the body surface by convection). Radiation occurs all the time, without direct contact, regardless of temperature differences between the organism and their environment (e.g. heat radiating from dark coloured surfaces). Evaporation is heat loss by water evaporation. This occurs most rapidly when the air is hot and dry (e.g. sweating).","Organisms exchange heat with their environment through various mechanisms, including behavioral, structural, and physiological adaptations. Endotherms, such as mammals and birds, generate most of their heat through metabolism and use insulation, metabolic rate variation, and skin vasodilation to conserve or lose heat. Ectotherms, like fish, reptiles, and insects, rely on external sources for heat energy. Plants also exchange heat with the environment through mechanisms such as stomata, which regulate water balance and gas exchange.",0.529,0.507,0.518
128,What are three mechanisms humans use to produce heat?,Answers may include: • voluntary movement/physical exercise • shivering thermogenesis • non-shivering thermogenesis • increasing rate of cellular respiration (metabolism).,"Humans use three mechanisms to produce heat: 

1. Increasing metabolism - this is the main source of heat production when the body is at rest.
2. Activation of the thyroid gland - this reduces the rate of metabolism in cells by reducing the amount of thyroxine produced, generating less heat.
3. Shivering - rapid contraction of muscles generates heat in the body.

These mechanisms are regulated by the hypothalamus and involve the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).",0.457,0.516,0.484
129,What are three mechanisms humans use to lose heat?,"Answers may include: • evaporative cooling, which occurs through sweating or perspiring • rate of cellular respiration decreases in internal organs, which decreases body temperature • covering your body with water, spraying water on your skin has the same effect as sweating • swimming will cause heat loss through conduction across the skin when you are in cool water; further cooling occurs when you are out of the water (evaporative cooling) • vasodilation is the dilation of the blood vessels in the skin; dilation means more blood is sent to the extremities; heat is lost to the environment by radiation and convection (especially if it is windy) • changing body shape to increase surface area • removing clothing will reduce the layer of insulation and allow heat to escape.","Humans use three main mechanisms to lose heat: vasodilation, sweating, and decreasing metabolic rate. Vasodilation brings more blood to the skin's surface, allowing excess heat to be lost. Sweating involves the secretion of liquid sweat that evaporates and carries heat away from the body. Decreasing metabolic rate reduces the amount of heat produced by cells in the body.",0.654,0.549,0.597
130,"What is the main role of insulin, and how does this hormone function?",The overall effect of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels. It does this by: • increasing conversion of glucose to fat in fat cells • increasing uptake of glucose in muscle and fat cells • increasing the conversion of glucose to the storage compound glycogen for storage in the liver.,"The main role of insulin is to regulate blood sugar levels by facilitating the conversion of glucose into glycogen in cells, which ultimately helps to decrease blood glucose concentration. Insulin functions by binding to specific receptors on target cells, such as liver, muscle, and fat cells, triggering a response that maintains glucose homeostasis throughout the body.",0.677,0.713,0.695
131,What are 'signalling molecules'?,Signalling molecules are chemicals involved in communication between cells within the body.,"Signaling molecules are proteins that play a crucial role in cell-to-cell interaction and communication. These proteins can function as pores or form active carrier systems, channels for transport, or receptors, allowing cells to recognize each other and respond to specific signals from substances like hormones. Glycoproteins, which have proteins attached to carbohydrates, serve as antigens, allowing the immune system to distinguish between foreign particles and the body's own cells.",0.502,0.762,0.605
132,Describe the feature of a target cell that makes it receptive to a particular signalling molecule.,Target cells have receptors that are specific to a particular signalling molecule; these receptors allow recognition of the signalling molecule and the target cells responds.,"The feature of a target cell that makes it receptive to a particular signaling molecule is its specific receptor. This receptor is typically located on the surface of the cell and has a unique structure that allows it to bind specifically to the signaling molecule. In the context of hormonal signaling, for example, hormones such as insulin or epinephrine bind to receptors on the surface of target cells, triggering a signaling cascade within the cytoplasm that ultimately leads to changes in gene transcription and cellular function.",0.543,0.742,0.627
133,Which type of nervous system response protects the body,"The reflex response, which is an involuntary action to remove the body from further pain and injury","The type of nervous system response that protects the body from changes is called homeostatic response. This occurs when the body detects a change through sensory receptors, sends a signal to the control centre, and then activates an effector to counteract the change and return the body to its normal state. This process involves both the nervous and endocrine systems working together to maintain homeostasis.",0.484,0.58,0.528
134,Describe how adaptations are beneficial to the survival of an individual organism and to a species.,"Those organisms that are best suited to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous adaptations to their offspring. Adaptations help individual organisms survive and they are also critical for the survival and reproduction of populations and species. Adaptations are inherited characteristics and are the qualities that the theory of evolution by natural selection and the survival of the fittest are based on.","Adaptations play a crucial role in increasing the ability of an individual organism and its species to survive. Structural, physiological, and behavioral adaptations all contribute to this increase. For instance, echidnas' long tongues help them eat ants and insects, while their strong leg muscles enable them to hop at fast paces over long periods without fatiguing. Similarly, cacti's water storage stems allow it to survive in arid environments. These adaptations often result from random variations that arise during the process of natural selection, as seen in the examples of finches on the Galapagos Islands and Australian flora and fauna. Ultimately, adaptations enhance an organism's ability to cope with its environment, increasing its chances of survival and reproduction.",0.528,0.618,0.569
135,How does evaporative cooling work? Give examples of evaporative cooling in animals.,"When water on skin evaporates to gas, it transfers some of body’s heat to the atmosphere, causing cooling. Examples include humans sweating, kangaroos licking their forearm fur, and elephants wallowing in mud or spraying water","Evaporative cooling is a process where an animal loses heat by evaporating water from its surface. This can be seen in animals that live in hot environments, such as deserts or tropical forests. For example, camels and horses will sweat to cool down their bodies when they are overheated. In addition, some animals have specialized structures that help them lose heat through evaporation, such as the nasal passages of elephants, which allow them to radiate excess heat away from their brain.

In terms of examples of evaporative cooling in animals, many species use this process to regulate their body temperature. For instance, dogs will pant to cool down when they are overheated, and cats will also pant or lick their paws to help regulate their body temperature.",0.538,0.597,0.566
136,What is the liver's role in homeostasis? Outline the mechanism for this control.,"The liver minimises the greater changes in blood glucose levels that would otherwise occur after meals. The liver converts excess glucose to glycogen. If the liver is full of glycogen, the liver converts any further excess of glucose to fat, which is stored in adipose tissue. After treatment, blood returning to the heart has a relatively normal level of glucose.","The liver plays a crucial role in homeostasis by regulating blood glucose levels through negative feedback mechanisms. When blood glucose concentration increases, the liver is stimulated to convert stored glycogen into glucose and release it into the bloodstream, lowering glucose levels. Conversely, when blood glucose concentration decreases, the liver is stimulated to absorb excess glucose from the bloodstream and store it as glycogen. This process helps maintain a stable blood glucose level within narrow limits.",0.662,0.677,0.669
137,Give at least three examples of water-conserving adaptations in plants.,"Answers may include—reduced leaf area, tough cuticles, extensive root systems, strap-like leaves that may roll up during water shortages, leaves coated with fine hairs to cool the surface, water storage in tissues or stem, spines, spherical form.","Here are three examples of water-conserving adaptations in plants:

1. Sunken stomata: Some plants have sunken stomata, which allows moist air to be trapped in the pit, reducing the difference in osmotic pressure outside the stoma and in the leaf.
2. Hairy leaves: Plants with hairy leaves trap water vapour from transpiration, creating a humid microclimate that reduces transpiration.
3. Waxy cuticle: Some plants have a waxy cuticle lining their stems and leaves, providing a waterproof barrier to reduce water loss.

These adaptations help plants conserve water and survive in environments where water is scarce or unpredictable.",0.487,0.53,0.508
138,Why are all newborn babies tested for phenylketonuria (PKU) disease?,"Early detection of PKU enables caregivers to change the diet of the newborn, which prevents damage and reduces complications from the disease.","Newborn babies are tested for phenylketonuria (PKU) because it's a genetic disease that can cause serious intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and other health problems if left untreated. If diagnosed early, babies with PKU can be placed on a special diet to manage the condition and live a normal, healthy life. The Guthrie test is used to screen for PKU by detecting the presence of phenylalanine in a newborn's blood sample.",0.519,0.611,0.562
139,What are oligodendrocytes?,Cells of the central nervous system that produce myelin.,"Oligodendrocytes are not mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on general knowledge, oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cell found in the central nervous system that play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath around axons. They are essential for the proper functioning of neurons and the transmission of nerve impulses.",0.422,0.706,0.529
140,What is myelin composed of?,Lipids and some proteins.,"Myelin is composed of lipids, which are a type of lipid molecule that provides structural support and insulation to the myelin sheath. The lipids in myelin are primarily made up of galactocerebroside and sulfatide molecules, which are essential for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath.",0.381,0.516,0.438
141,What does a nutritional disease result from?,"Nutritional diseases can be caused by a lack of, imbalance or sometimes over-consumption of certain nutrients","A nutritional disease can result from inadequate nutrient levels, poor diet, or changes in dietary elements. This can lead to various effects such as excess fat blocking vital organs, bodily swelling, glucose accumulation in the bloodstream, and weakness in bones or muscles. Inadequate or excessive nutrition can also cause undernutrition, overnutrition, or malnutrition, leading to conditions like scurvy, rickets, and obesity.",0.509,0.641,0.568
142,Outline the term malnutrition and discuss the difference between undernutrition and overnutrition.,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers two broad categories: • undernutrition, which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies (including a lack of vitamins and minerals) • overnutrition, which includes obesity and diet-related non-infectious diseases.","The term ""malnutrition"" refers to a state of being where an individual's diet lacks adequate nutrients, resulting in impaired physical and mental health. There are two main types of malnutrition: undernutrition and overnutrition.

Undernutrition occurs when an individual consumes insufficient amounts of essential nutrients such as protein, vitamins, and minerals, leading to a lack of energy and nutrient deficiencies. This can result in conditions like rickets, scurvy, and iron-deficiency anemia, which can cause symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, and weakness.

On the other hand, overnutrition occurs when an individual consumes excessive amounts of calories or nutrients, leading to an imbalance in their diet. This can result in conditions like obesity and its related health problems.",0.647,0.663,0.655
143,List some of the major non-infectious disease risk factors associated with having a raised body mass index (BMI).,"Cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (such as osteoarthritis of the joints), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney and colon).","Some major non-infectious disease risk factors associated with having a raised body mass index (BMI) include:

* Genetic predisposition: If you have a family history of obesity, you are more likely to develop it.
* Environmental factors: A diet high in processed foods and sugar, lack of physical activity, and other environmental exposures can contribute to weight gain.
* Nutritional disorders: Deficiencies or excesses of certain nutrients, such as vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids, can affect metabolic processes and increase the risk of obesity.

Note that these factors are not directly related to the provided documents, which primarily discuss plant adaptations for water balance, non-infectious diseases in humans, and epidemiological studies.",0.426,0.51,0.464
144,Discuss if a poor diet is the only contributor to the development of coronary heart disease.,"No, although poor nutrition is a contributing factor, other lifestyle aspects can also contribute to arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease including factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and obesity.","A poor diet is one of several contributors to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). While a diet lacking essential nutrients or rich in unhealthy fats can increase the risk of CHD, it is not the sole cause. Other factors such as lifestyle habits, environmental exposures, and genetic predisposition also play a role. A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources can help reduce the risk of CHD, but it is just one aspect of a overall approach to preventing the disease.",0.573,0.67,0.618
145,What is the difference between non-specific and specific immunotherapies?,"Non-specific immunotherapies act indirectly, stimulating the immune response more generally, which can improve its response against cancer cells. Specific immunotherapies target cancer cells directly, stimulating an adaptive immune response against the cancer cells.","Non-specific immunotherapies refer to the body's innate defense mechanisms that respond to foreign substances without a specific response to each antigen. Specific immunotherapies, on the other hand, involve the activation of immune cells like B cells and T cells that target specific antigens. This targeted approach allows for a more effective response against specific pathogens or cancer cells.",0.631,0.732,0.678
146,"What is the difference between chimeric, humanised and human monoclonal antibodies?","Chimeric monoclonal antibodies have a mixture of mouse and human components, whereas humanised monoclonal antibodies are mostly human components and human monoclonal antibodies consist entirely of human components.","The difference between chimeric, humanized, and human monoclonal antibodies lies beyond the provided documents. However, I can provide a general explanation.

Chimeric antibodies are engineered by combining human and murine (mouse) sequences to create a hybrid antibody that retains the desired properties of both species. Humanized antibodies, on the other hand, are human antibodies with some mouse-derived regions, such as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), grafted onto a human framework.

Human monoclonal antibodies are fully human, meaning they are composed entirely of human sequences and do not contain any murine components. This type of antibody is often preferred for therapeutic applications due to its reduced immunogenicity and improved efficacy.

In summary, chimeric antibodies combine human and mouse sequences, humanized antibodies graft mouse-derived regions onto a human framework, and human monoclonal antibodies are entirely composed of human sequences.",0.565,0.799,0.662
147,Bispecific antibodies are produced artificially. How are these antibodies different from those produced naturally by the immune system?,"The two antigen binding sites on naturally produced antibodies are identical and both bind to identical antigens, but the two binding sites on biospecific antibodies are different and bind to different antigens.","Bispecific antibodies produced artificially differ from those produced naturally by the immune system in that they are created through human intervention, whereas natural antibodies arise from the interaction between antigens and immune cells. Artificially produced bispecific antibodies have a specific target, whereas natural antibodies are generated to combat pathogens, with the ability to recognize and bind to multiple antigens.",0.562,0.625,0.592
148,Describe how a tumour cell is able to evade the host immune response.,Tumour cells evade the host’s immune system by expressing defective MHC-I molecules (so that cytotoxic T lymphocytes cannot detect that the cells are defective). They produce immunosuppressive cytokines or release enzymes that suppress T lymphocyte responses.,"Tumour cells are able to evade the host immune response by exploiting various mechanisms that subvert or suppress the activity of immune cells. One way tumour cells do this is by producing immunosuppressive molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines, which can inhibit the activation and proliferation of T cells and other immune cells. Additionally, tumour cells may also exploit immune checkpoints, such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4/CD80, to suppress the activity of cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, tumour cells may also undergo genetic alterations that make them less recognizable by the immune system, making it more difficult for immune cells to target them effectively.",0.623,0.697,0.658
149,"Define ""epidemiology"".",Epidemiology is the study of epidemics of infectious diseases in humans from developed countries.,"Epidemiology is the application of scientific methods to the study of disease in populations for the purpose of prevention and control. It involves the consideration of various aspects, including the description or definition of the disease, possible causes, occurrence and transmission, risk factors, control measures, and prevention strategies. Epidemiological studies can be descriptive, analytical, or interventional, and are used to generate hypotheses about causes of disease, test these hypotheses, and determine the effectiveness of interventions.",0.499,0.737,0.595
150,What is the difference between analytical studies in epidemiology and intervention studies?,"Analytical studies are planned investigations, which test a specific hypothesis. While intervention studies do not test a hypothesis but instead measure the effectiveness and safety of an intervention.","The main difference between analytical studies in epidemiology and intervention studies is the purpose of each. Analytical studies aim to test hypotheses about the causes of disease or identify risk factors, typically using observational data and statistical analysis. On the other hand, intervention studies are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment or public health campaign by testing its impact on a population or group. Intervention studies often involve experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials, whereas analytical studies rely on existing data and statistical methods.",0.539,0.672,0.598
151,Outline the six stages of collecting data for epidemiological studies.,"1 A diagnostic phase, in which the presence of the disease is confirmed. 2 A descriptive phase, which describes the populations at risk and the distribution of the disease within a population. This may then allow a hypothesis to be formed about the likely cause of a disease. 3 An investigative phase, which involves the implementation of a series of field studies. 4 An experimental phase, in which experiments are performed under controlled conditions to test the hypotheses in more detail. 5 An analytical phase, in which the results produced are analysed. 6 A decision-making phase, in which knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease is used to explore the various options available for managing health practices.","The six stages of collecting data for epidemiological studies are:

1. Diagnostic stage: where the presence of the disease is confirmed.
2. Descriptive stage: where the population at risk and distribution of the disease is described.
3. Investigative stage: where studies are implemented to investigate whether the evidence supports a hypothesis about the disease.
4. Experimental stage: where experiments are performed under controlled conditions to test the hypothesis.

These stages help in generating hypotheses, testing them, and determining the cause of the disease.",0.763,0.717,0.739
152,Define the term 'public health program'.,"Public health programs are developed to improve the safety and health of communities through education, policy-making and research for disease prevention, treatment and cure.","A public health program refers to efforts aimed at improving overall health and preventing disease in populations. This includes initiatives such as surveillance, monitoring, screening, and clearance procedures, as well as education and awareness campaigns, vaccination programs, and use of pesticides to control disease transmission. The goal is to empower individuals to make healthy choices and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks.",0.592,0.685,0.635
153,What is population screening?,Population screening is a test offered to individuals in target groups to test or examine for non-infectious diseases.,"Based on the provided documents, population screening refers to the study of genetic characteristics of a population, including the frequencies of variants of alleles, how these frequencies change over time and space, and how this information can be used to make decisions about conservation of endangered species. It involves analyzing data from a large-scale collaborative project and uses various technologies to determine inheritance patterns in a population.",0.483,0.599,0.535
154,What is genetic engineering? Why is it an important area of research for non-infectious disease prevention?,"Genetic engineering is the ability to alter DNA. It is important in non-infectious disease prevention because there is potential for individuals to replace a defective, disease-causing gene or its protein product.","Genetic engineering is a technique for altering an organism's DNA composition using laboratory-based technologies. This involves changing a single base pair, deleting an area of DNA, or adding a new piece of DNA. Genetic engineering has aided in the mass manufacture of hormones and enzymes that can aid in disease cures and reduce their deadly effects.

Genetic engineering is an important area of research for non-infectious disease prevention because it allows scientists to weaken viruses or cause harmless viruses to produce specific proteins from a dangerous disease, triggering an immune response. This technology has been used to develop vaccines, such as the Covid-19 vaccine, which provides cells with snippets of mRNA that produce certain proteins for the body to identify and prepare to fight off.

Additionally, genetic engineering can be used in industry, such as producing chemicals, and in agriculture, where genetically modified organisms can increase crop yields or resist pests.",0.538,0.709,0.611
155,Describe the two functions of the ear ossicles,"The three ear bones (ossicles) amplify (increase) the sound volume and transmit the vibrations from tympanic membrane to oval window, where they pass into the cochlea.","The two main functions of the ear ossicles are to amplify and transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the oval window. The malleus, incus, and stapes bones work together to increase the intensity of sound vibrations, allowing them to be transmitted effectively to the inner ear. This process enables us to perceive and interpret sound waves accurately.",0.648,0.696,0.671
156,"Compare these three technologies that could be used to assist with hearing loss: hearing aid, bone conduction implant cochlear implant","All three technologies can at least restore awareness of sound and aid with lip reading skills. The hearing aid is the simplest, least expensive and can restore nearly normal hearing by amplifying external sounds. It only works if all the functions of the ear are essentially intact, just impaired. A bone conduction implant requires surgery and does not restore normal type hearing. It would be used for a person whose inner ear still functions but not the outer or middle ear. A cochlear implant is the most radical solution used for a person who has lost function of the cochlea but still has use of the auditory nerves. It gives sound awareness but not normal style hearing and is most useful when surgically installed during early childhood.","Here's a comparison of the three technologies that can assist with hearing loss: hearing aids, bone conduction implants, and cochlear implants.

Hearing aids amplify sound vibrations to better enable their transmission to the middle ear and inner ear. Bone conduction implants bypass outer and middle ear defects by transmitting vibrations directly through the bone to the inner ear, making them suitable for conductive hearing disorders. Cochlear implants convert sound waves into electrical impulses sent to an electrode array implanted in the cochlea, stimulating nerve endings and enabling people with profound hearing loss to hear.

Each technology has its unique features and limitations. For instance, hearing aids are external devices that amplify sound vibrations, while bone conduction implants require surgery to implant a titanium device behind the ear. Cochlear implants involve a more extensive procedure, including surgical implantation of an electrode array in the cochlea.

Overall, these technologies offer varying levels of assistance for individuals with different types and severities of hearing loss, enabling them to communicate and participate in daily life more effectively.",0.616,0.61,0.613
157,Describe two functions of the retina.,"When light rays from an object are focused on the retina an image of the object is formed and messages sent to the brain for interpretation. The cone photoreceptor cells in the retina detect different colours in bright light, especially in the central fovea (macula) position. The rod photoreceptor cells around the edges of the retina are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colours so they are most useful for detecting movement at night or in a darkened room.","The retina has two primary functions. Firstly, it converts light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve, enabling us to perceive visual information. Secondly, the retina processes and interprets these electrical signals, allowing us to distinguish between different colors and light levels.",0.598,0.555,0.575
158,Explain how the eye detects different colours.,"There are three types of cone cells, each with a photopsin pigment sensitive to different light wavelengths. They can distinguish between red, green and blue. Other colours are detected as a mix of stimulations and interpreted by the brain. If all three colour cones are equally stimulated, the brain knows from experience to see this as white.","The eye detects different colors through the combination of signals sent by the cones in the retina. The cones contain one of three iodopsin pigments (blue, green, and red), which change light energy into electrical impulses when stimulated by light. This stimulation causes the formation of an electrochemical signal that is sent to the brain for processing. The brain interprets this combination of signals as different colors, allowing us to perceive a wide range of hues.",0.641,0.668,0.654
159,Discuss the value of having binocular vision.,"Binocular vision requires two eyes quite close together facing forwards, such as humans have. The brain can then learn to use the two different images to form single 3D pictures and determine distance and relative sizes of the objects being viewed. This is valuable for playing sports, driving a vehicle, walking on uneven ground, on stairs, determining the position of things when we reach for them and so on. Personal safety often depends on being able to accurately judge distance and dimensions. Having both eyes facing forward does restrict the field of view, so animals that need to be more aware of prey and predators around them may get more value from eyes placed to the side with monocular vision (e.g. mice, lizards and snakes).","Having binocular vision is crucial for humans as it enables us to perceive depth and distance effectively. The combination of two images from each eye, processed by the brain, allows us to create a three-dimensional representation of our surroundings. This is particularly important for everyday tasks, such as navigating through spaces or judging distances between objects.",0.672,0.58,0.623
160,"Arrange the following structures of the excretory system in order, from the largest in size to the smallest: nephron, glomerulus, kidney, renal capillary.","The largest is kidney, then nephron, glomerulus and renal capillary is the smallest structure","Here is the answer:

The structures of the excretory system in order, from largest to smallest are: kidney, nephron, glomerulus, renal capillary.",0.629,0.747,0.683
161,Name the two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney.,ADH (antidiuretic hormone)—responds to water level and aldosterone—responds to salt level.,"The two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney are aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of salts in the loop of Henle, while ADH stimulates the reabsorption of water in the kidney.",0.571,0.705,0.631
162,Describe two examples of a kidney disorder,"An example answer is: Nephrosclerosis—nephrosclerosis is caused by hypertension (high blood pressure) which can lead to hardening of the blood vessels in the kidney and loss of glomerular filtration function. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic condition that causes kidney malfunction and may eventually lead to kidney failure. The renal cortex and medulla regions in the kidney are overgrown with cysts preventing their normal functioning. Cysts are small sacs usually filled with fluid. OR any other kidney disease (e.g. glomerulonephritis [inflammation of kidney filters], diabetic nephropathy [kidney damage resulting from type 1 and type 2 diabetes], reflux nephropathy).","Two examples of kidney disorders are Glomerulonephritis and Diabetic Nephropathy. Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomerulus, which can occur after a bacterial infection or be a common type of kidney disorder. It can cause kidney damage and affect the kidneys' ability to filter waste from the blood. Diabetic Nephropathy is a condition caused by diabetes that leads to kidney damage and a decrease in the kidneys' ability to remove wastes and excess fluids from the body.",0.727,0.64,0.681
