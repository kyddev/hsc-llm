1,Define 'asexual reproduction',"Asexual reproduction is a type of reproductive process in which offspring are produced from one parent without the involvement of gametes (sex cells). In this process, the genetic material from two separate parents is combined to produce offspring that are genetically identical to both parents.","Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction where an organism produces offspring that are genetically identical to itself, without the involvement of another individual. This process involves only one parent and does not require fertilization or the exchange of genetic material with another organism. Examples include budding, fragmentation, and spore formation in plants and animals. It allows for rapid population growth and is common in single-celled organisms and some simple multicellular organisms.",0.61,0.739,0.668
2,Identify the sort of cell division that is involved in asexual reproduction,"The cell division in asexual reproduction is mitosis, which produces an extra set of identical paired chromosomes.","Mitosis is the type of cell division involved in asexual reproduction. It results in two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell, allowing for the production of offspring without the involvement of gametes or fertilization. This process is commonly seen in plants and some animals that reproduce asexually.",0.581,0.717,0.641
3,Outline the ideal environmental conditions for asexual reproduction and explain why these conditions are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms,"Stable and uniform environments with a good supply of resources provide ideal conditions for asexual reproduction. These environments are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms because organisms that are produced via asexual reproduction are clones of their parent already adapted to the stable environment. Since the parent is surviving in the ideal environment, the offspring will also be well suited to this environment, resulting in a large successful population for this organism. However, they will lack the genetic variation required for adaptation to changing conditions.","The ideal environmental conditions for asexual reproduction include stable temperatures between 20-30°C, high humidity (60-80%), and minimal light exposure. These conditions allow for optimal metabolic activity, cell division, and growth of the organism, making it easier to reproduce without the need for genetic recombination. The stability of these conditions also reduces stress on the organism, allowing it to focus energy on reproduction rather than survival. This environment enables asexually reproducing organisms to thrive and efficiently produce offspring.",0.604,0.641,0.622
4,List the key events in binary fission for bacteria,"The key events that happen in binary fission for bacteria goes as follows:

1. The circular DNA molecule is duplicated within the nucleoid. 
2. The cell grows until it has almost doubled in size. 
3. A new cell wall and membrane form between the separating chromosomes, dividing the cell into two relatively equal halves. 
4. These halves eventually separate, forming two identical daughter cells from the single parent cell.","Binary fission involves the following key events:

1. Replication of DNA: The bacterial cell replicates its DNA.
2. Increase in cell size: The cell grows and increases in size to accommodate the replicated DNA.
3. Formation of a constriction: A constriction forms in the center of the cell, separating the replicated DNA into two identical sets.
4. Division of the cell: The cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing an identical set of chromosomes.",0.695,0.697,0.696
5,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a gamete? Give an example of each,"Somatic cells are all the diploid cells in the body of an organism, apart from the sex cells (gametes). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells. Gametes are the haploid sex cells such as the egg/ovum and sperm cells, that combine in sexual reproduction. They are produced from germ cells by meiosis

","A somatic cell is any cell in the body that is not involved in reproduction, such as skin cells or muscle cells. In contrast, a gamete is a reproductive cell, specifically a sperm or egg cell that contains half the genetic material necessary for creating a new individual. An example of a somatic cell is a red blood cell, which carries oxygen throughout the body. An example of a gamete is an ovum (egg cell), which is produced by females and can be fertilized to form a zygote.",0.661,0.708,0.683
6,Explain the meaning of the term 'alternation of generations',The term ‘alternation of generations’ means the swapping between haploid (1n) and diploid (2n) stages in the life cycle of eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction. An example is the diploid mushroom fruiting body that produces haploid spores for the next stage.,"Alternation of generations refers to a life cycle pattern in which two distinct phases of an organism's life exist, often with different physical characteristics and reproductive strategies. In this process, one phase produces offspring that are genetically identical but morphologically different from themselves, while the other phase is responsible for producing offspring that are similar in form to their parents. This phenomenon is commonly observed in plants and some animal species, such as certain types of algae and fungi. It allows these organisms to adapt to changing environments through genetic variation.",0.512,0.524,0.518
7,Compare pollination in gymnosperm and angiosperm plants,"Both gymnosperms and angiosperms produce haploid male gametes contained inside pollen grains. 

The difference is in the way that cross-pollination occurs. All cone plants (gymnosperms) are wind pollinated, that is, they produce very lightweight pollen in great quantities on male cones and release it into the air to be carried by wind. By chance some will pollinate female cones of the same gymnosperm species. 

Most flowering plants (angiosperms) have adaptations for more reliable cross-pollination, often involving a symbiotic relationship with an animal. Insects (especially bees), birds and small mammals are attracted to the flowers by colour or scent. They get rewards of nectar or pollen and in the process carry pollen grains from one flower to the next. Some angiosperms are wind-pollinated but most have evolved the more efficient pollination partnership with an animal species.","Pollination in gymnosperms is typically anemophilous (wind-pollinated), where pollen is released from male cones and carried by wind to female cones for fertilization. In contrast, angiosperms exhibit a diverse range of pollination methods, including entomophily (insect-pollinated) and ornithophily (bird-pollinated), among others. Angiosperm flowers often have specialized structures such as petals, sepals, and nectaries to attract pollinators. This diversity in pollination strategies is a key factor contributing to the success of angiosperms over gymnosperms.",0.639,0.615,0.627
8,Classify the three groups of mammals based on reproductive strategies and give two examples for each group,"All mammals have fur and feed their young with milk. There are three groups based on reproductive strategies: 

1. placental mammals—female carries fetus inside her body, nourished through a placenta until fully developed (e.g. human, dog, lion, elephant and whale) 
2. marsupial mammals—fetus born at an early stage, complete their development in external pouch while suckling (e.g. kangaroo, koala, wombat and quokka) 
3. monotreme mammals—female lays eggs with leathery shells then protects them and feeds the young with milk after hatching (e.g. platypus and echidna)
","Based on their reproductive strategies, mammals can be classified into three groups:

**Group 1: Precocial Mammals**
These mammals have a relatively short gestation period and are able to walk or swim shortly after birth. Examples include sheep and deer.

**Group 2: Altricial Mammals**
These mammals have a longer gestation period and give birth to relatively undeveloped young that require extensive parental care. Examples include primates, such as humans and monkeys.

**Group 3: Intermediate Mammals**
These mammals have a moderate gestation period and give birth to young that are somewhat developed but still require some parental care. Examples include rodents, such as mice and rats.",0.562,0.558,0.56
9,"Distinguish between zygote, morula, blastocyst, gastrula, embryo and fetus","Zygote is the first stage after fertilisation, the diploid cell that results from fusion of a haploid egg and sperm. 

Morula is the next stage after the zygote undergoes mitosis to become two cells. The morula continues to divide until it consists of 16 cells and then enters the uterus. 

Blastocyst is the next stage when the morula has divided by mitosis into many smaller cells that are organised into two layers. 

Gastrula develops from the blastocyst when three layers of cells have formed. 

Embryo is the next stage until major organs have developed. In humans this stage is from three to eight weeks after fertilisation (or five to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period). 

Fetus is the final stage of development when all of the major organs have developed. This stage lasts until birth.","A zygote is a single fertilized cell resulting from the union of an egg and sperm. A morula forms when the zygote undergoes several cleavages, becoming a compact cluster of cells. The blastocyst stage follows, where the morula differentiates into two distinct groups of cells: an inner cell mass and an outer trophoblast layer. The gastrula stage marks the beginning of embryonic development, followed by the embryo, which is characterized by the formation of three primary germ layers, and finally, the fetus, which develops from the embryo after approximately 6 weeks of gestation.",0.682,0.648,0.664
10,Where would you find an acrosome and what is its function?,"The acrosome is a specialized structure at the front (or anterior) of a sperm cell. It contains enzymes called acroplasms or hyaluronidases, which break down the outer layers around an egg (oocyte) to facilitate fertilization.","The acrosome is a cap-like structure found at the tip of a sperm cell. Its primary function is to release enzymes that help break down the outer layer of the egg during fertilization, allowing the sperm to penetrate and fuse with the egg. This process is crucial for successful fertilization and the initiation of embryonic development. The acrosome contains hyaluronidase, an enzyme that helps dissolve the jelly-like coating surrounding the egg.",0.718,0.748,0.733
11,Where would you find a follicle and what is its function?,"A follicle is a group of cells in the ovary that surround an oocyte as it matures. The follicle provides protection and nutrition to the egg, then ruptures to release the egg through the surface of the ovary for ovulation.","A follicle is typically found in the skin or on the scalp, where it surrounds and protects a hair shaft. Its primary function is to produce sebum, an oily substance that helps to moisturize and protect the surrounding skin and hair. The follicle also provides a protective environment for the hair growth process. In females, follicles are also responsible for producing eggs in the ovaries.",0.621,0.664,0.642
12,Compare reproduction in placental and marsupial mammals,"Both placentals and marsupials are viviparous, that is they bear live young. The difference is that marsupial young are born at a very early stage of their development before they are fully formed. The young must crawl up into the maternal pouch, attach to a nipple and complete their development in the external pouch. The mother can then start another cycle of reproduction and does not have the burden of growing the young in her uterus. Placental females nourish the fetus inside the uterus until it is fully formed. Some placental young can start moving around independently within minutes after birth (e.g. calves, lambs and foals). The young are better protected during fetal development, but the mother is more restricted by the period of gestation and cannot breed again until after the birth.","Reproduction in placental mammals involves a longer gestation period, with the fetus developing inside the uterus and receiving nutrients through the umbilical cord. In contrast, marsupials have a shorter gestation period, with the young born after a relatively short development period, then completing their growth inside a pouch on the mother's body where they continue to develop and nurse. This difference in reproductive strategy is due to the unique developmental characteristics of each group. Marsupials give birth to underdeveloped offspring that are more like embryos than fully formed mammals.",0.64,0.617,0.628
13,"Explain how two glands positioned in the brain, the hypothalamus and the pituitary, can control the reproductive organs","The hypothalamus acts as a master control centre, receiving information by nerve messages and by monitoring the blood as it flows through this area of the brain. It maintains homeostatic balance and reproductive processes for the body by sending out nerve messages and/or releasing hormones to other appropriate glands. The pituitary is thus controlled by messages from the hypothalamus for release of its hormones to act on target cells in the reproductive system. Hormones from the pituitary gland travel in the blood to their targets such as the mammary glands, the ovaries and testes. Some pituitary hormones act directly and others stimulate release of local hormones that act on their target cells by diffusing through the extracellular fluid.","The hypothalamus and pituitary glands work together to regulate the reproductive system by controlling the production of hormones that stimulate or inhibit the release of sex hormones from the gonads. The hypothalamus secretes hormones that either stimulate or suppress the pituitary gland's release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn regulate the reproductive organs' function, such as ovulation and sperm production. This feedback loop allows for precise control over the reproductive cycle. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands work together to maintain a delicate balance of hormones that support or suppress fertility.",0.652,0.627,0.639
14,Identify the steps of artificial selection that would lead to the production of large corn cobs,"The steps of artificial selection that would lead to production of large corn cobs include:

1. Select corn plants with the largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
2. Select offspring plants with largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
3. Continue this process until the population reliably produces large cobs.","Farmers would first select and breed corn plants with larger cobs in a process called phenotypic selection. They would then allow these plants to produce seeds, which would be harvested and replanted to propagate the desired trait. Over multiple generations, this selective breeding would lead to an increase in the average size of the corn cobs as farmers continue to select for the largest individuals. This process would eventually result in the production of large corn cobs through artificial selection.",0.604,0.637,0.62
15,Outline how selective breeding has changed with the development of new technology,"Selective breeding traditionally used cross breeding over many generations. However, new technology allows desired genes to be transferred more rapidly and accurately, and allows creation of transgenic species.","Selective breeding has evolved significantly with advancements in technology, enabling more precise and efficient selection processes. The use of genetic markers, DNA testing, and genomics has allowed breeders to identify specific genes associated with desired traits, streamlining the breeding process. Additionally, technologies like artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and reproductive biotechnology have improved fertility rates and enabled the creation of genetically identical offspring. This has accelerated the development of new breeds and improved existing ones.",0.584,0.68,0.628
16,Identity two common methods of plant propagation used in selective breeding,"Artificial pollination ensures that only the chosen male plant will fertilise the new seeds. Plant cuttings, grafting and using runners or suckers will produce identical plants for the next generation (e.g. for growing bananas commercially).","Cutting and grafting are two common methods of plant propagation used in selective breeding. Cutting involves taking a stem or leaf section from a mature plant and rooting it to produce a new individual with similar characteristics. Grafting involves joining a piece of stem (scion) from one plant onto the root system of another plant (rootstock), allowing the scion to grow while retaining desirable traits from the rootstock. These methods enable breeders to selectively propagate plants with desired qualities.",0.539,0.577,0.557
17,Outline four methods of cloning currently used in horticulture and agriculture,"The cloning methods used in agriculture and horticulture are: 
• cuttings and grafting 
• plant tissue culture 
• embryo splitting 
• nuclear transfer.","Somatic embryogenesis involves the regeneration of plants from somatic cells, allowing for the mass production of genetically identical plants. Micropropagation uses tissue culture techniques to rapidly multiply desirable plant varieties. Meristem culture involves the use of shoot tips or meristematic tissues to produce new plants with improved traits. Genetic engineering through biotechnology allows for the introduction of specific genes into crops to enhance desired characteristics.",0.491,0.54,0.514
18,Recall a situation where plant tissue culture is of benefit,"An endangered species could be saved by producing many new plants from a small piece of the rare parent plant. This strategy has been used for the Wollemi pine. Mass production of food plants with tissue culture saves time, money and reduces land use.","Plant tissue culture has been beneficial in producing disease-free and genetically uniform plants for commercial cultivation. For example, the technique was used to mass-produce disease-free potato tubers, which helped to eradicate the Irish Potato Famine virus that had devastated Ireland's crop yields in the 19th century. This method also enabled the rapid propagation of orchids and other ornamental plants, making them widely available for commercial sale.",0.505,0.548,0.526
19,Discuss the case for and against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture. Use some specific examples in your answer.,"• For the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—Many benefits come from selective breeding
 evidenced by the fact that all our agricultural plants and animals have been improved for human use by controlling
 their breeding. We have more nutritious and palatable fruit like apples and grain crops. Farm animals are more
 productive for milk, eggs and meat.
 • Against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—One risk is that a GM species could start
 breeding with related wild species such as the GM salmon. We also risk a further reduction in natural genetic variation.
 There are also many ethical concerns around selectively breeding animals and the consequences for their welfare.","The manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture has both proponents and opponents. On one hand, genetic modification (GM) can increase crop yields, improve disease resistance, and enhance nutritional content, as seen in Golden Rice which contains beta-carotene to combat vitamin A deficiency. However, critics argue that GM crops can lead to the loss of biodiversity, contaminate non-GM crops, and pose unknown health risks, citing examples like the Roundup Ready soybeans which have been linked to increased herbicide use.",0.555,0.583,0.569
20,"Within a cell cycle, cell replication involves three phases. Identify and summarise the three phases.","The cell cycle involves three phases: interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis.
 Interphase involves the cell doubling its mass and duplicating all its components. DNA replication occurs during
 interphase.
 Mitosis is a process of division of the cell nucleus.
 Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells.","The three phases of cell replication within a cell cycle are Interphase, Mitosis, and Cytokinesis.

Interphase is the longest phase where the cell grows, prepares for DNA replication, and replicates its DNA. 
Mitosis is the phase where the replicated DNA is divided equally between two daughter cells.
Cytokinesis is the final phase where the cytoplasm divides and the cell splits into two daughter cells.",0.767,0.793,0.78
21,"Identify the two types of cell division, the number of daughter cells produced and the number of chromosomes in these daughter cells.","There are two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.

Mitosis: This process produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each having twice the number of chromosomes (2n). Mitosis is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in eukaryotes.
Meiosis: Meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes by half, resulting in four genetically distinct daughter cells. Each gamete has n chromosomes (23 in human sperm and egg). Meiosis increases genetic diversity, allowing for recombination and shuffling of alleles during sexual reproduction.","There are two main types of cell division: Mitosis and Meiosis. Mitosis produces 2 daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell (diploid). Meiosis, on the other hand, produces 4 daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell (haploid).",0.734,0.627,0.676
22,Recall the events that occur during interphase of the cell cycle,"During the S phase of interphase, DNA is synthesised (chromosomes are replicated); during G1 and G2—normal
 functioning of the cell occurs, the cell increases in size and replicates organelles, and materials are accumulated for
 mitosis; G0—resting phase or phase in which cells undergo cell differentiation to become specialised.","During interphase, which is the longest stage of the cell cycle, the cell grows and prepares for cell division. This phase is further divided into three stages: Gap 1 (G1), Synthesis (S), and Gap 2 (G2). In G1, the cell grows and increases its genetic material by producing new organelles and proteins. The S stage involves DNA replication, where the genetic material is duplicated to prepare for cell division.",0.662,0.675,0.668
23,Distinguish between a chromatid and a chromosome. When are they visible?,"Chromatids are replicates of the chromosome, joined at the centromere. When they separate at anaphase they are
 again called chromosomes. Chromosomes and chromatids become visible under a light microscope when they
 condense in prophase (and stay visible through metaphase, anaphase and telophase).","A chromatid is one of the two identical copies of DNA that make up a chromosome during the cell's interphase stage. Chromosomes, on the other hand, are composed of two joined chromatids and are visible during the prophase stage of mitosis or meiosis. During this stage, chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope due to their compacted structure. This visibility is temporary, lasting only until metaphase when they line up at the cell's equator.",0.624,0.701,0.661
24,Explain how cell division in plants is different from cell division in animals,"Plant cells do not usually have a centriole (a structure present in animal cells); they form spindle fibres by a different
 mechanism, so chromosomes align and chromatids separate as in other eukaryotic cells. During cytokinesis the
 membrane does not constrict as it does in animals, but a new division (the cell plate) forms across the cell, making a
 new cell wall, then new cell membranes for each daughter cell.","In plants, cell division occurs through a process called mitosis, where the chromosomes are duplicated and then separated into two identical sets, resulting in two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes. In contrast, animal cells undergo a similar process of mitosis, but also have a unique phase called cytokinesis, which involves the physical separation of the cytoplasm and cell membrane to form two distinct cells. Plant cells, however, lack a true nucleus during cell division, as their genetic material is contained within a large, central vacuole. This difference in cellular structure affects the process of cell division in plants compared to animals.",0.603,0.618,0.61
25,"Define 'apoptosis'. Explain the reasons for this process in a healthy organism, providing examples.","Apoptosis is a natural and highly controlled process of cell death within a multicellular organism. It is used to control
 the number of cells, to destroy cells with DNA damaged beyond repair and remove cells that have reached their ‘useby date’ or are surplus to body requirements. Examples in humans include: old red and white blood cells, damaged
 skin and intestinal lining cells, monthly menstruation to remove the extra lining of the uterus if pregnancy hasn’t
 occurred; in a developing human embryo: removal of excess brain cells and webbing between the digits. Examples in
 plants include: the root cap cells are destroyed by apoptosis and replaced as penetration into the soil damages them.
 Destruction of targeted cells for these reasons helps keep an organism renewed and healthy.","Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms, including humans. It's a natural and essential process that helps maintain tissue homeostasis by eliminating damaged or unwanted cells, such as those with genetic mutations or excessive growth. This process prevents the development of cancer and ensures proper organ function, for example, removing old or damaged neurons in the brain to make way for new ones. In healthy organisms, apoptosis is tightly regulated and occurs at a controlled rate to maintain tissue balance.",0.655,0.594,0.623
26,Outline the basic functions of DNA and RNA.,DNA carries the instructions that code for the production of RNA and proteins. DNA can self-replicate. RNA plays a major role in partnership with DNA for the process of protein synthesis,"DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) serves as a blueprint for life by storing genetic information in the form of nucleotide sequences. It is responsible for passing on traits from one generation to the next. RNA (Ribonucleic acid), on the other hand, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and gene expression by carrying genetic instructions from DNA to the ribosome.",0.499,0.671,0.573
27,"Distinguish between these terms: chromosome, DNA. genome, gene and allele.","A chromosome is a package of a single, very long DNA molecule coiled around a series of histone proteins.
 DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic information of organisms and determines their inherited characteristics.
 The genome of an organism is the sum total of an organism’s DNA, measured in the number of base pairs, contained
 in a haploid (n) set of chromosomes.
 A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a polypeptide. One or more polypeptides form proteins, which carry out
 functions in organisms.
 An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of the same gene (e.g. alleles for different eye colours).","A chromosome is a thread-like structure made up of DNA that carries genetic information in the nucleus of living cells. The DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms. A genome refers to the complete set of chromosomes or DNA in an organism, while a gene is a unit of heredity that is passed from one generation to the next and carries information for making a protein. An allele is a variant of a gene that occupies a specific location on a chromosome.",0.702,0.64,0.67
28,"Using the terms chromosome, histone, DNA and nucleosome, describe how DNA is packaged into a cell nucleus","A long thread of DNA is packed up so that it fits into the nucleus of every cell. The DNA in each chromosome is tightly
 coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. The combined loop of DNA and histone
 is called a nucleosome. Next the nucleosomes are packaged into a thread, which is sometimes described as ‘beads
 on a string’. The end result is a fibre known as chromatin. The chromatin is looped and coiled again to produce a
 super-coiled thread-like structure called a chromosome.","DNA is packaged into a cell nucleus through the formation of chromatin, which consists of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins. This complex is known as a nucleosome, where approximately 147 base pairs of DNA are coiled around a histone octamer composed of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The nucleosomes then further compact to form higher-order chromatin structures, ultimately fitting into the limited space within the cell nucleus. This packaging is crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining genome stability.",0.635,0.662,0.648
29,How do cells ensure that the DNA is copied correctly to the daughter cells?,"A strand of the parent DNA molecule is used as a template strand on which the new complementary strand is
 synthesised. As each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old and one newly synthesised strand, the exact DNA
 pattern can be replicated accurately.","Cells employ a complex process called proofreading and editing during DNA replication to ensure accuracy. Enzymes such as helicase, topoisomerase, and polymerases work together to unwind, cut, and rejoin the DNA strands, respectively. Additionally, the cell's own genetic material serves as a template for the new DNA synthesis, allowing for precise copying of the original sequence. This multi-step process minimizes errors in DNA replication.",0.52,0.629,0.569
30,Assess the role of enzymes in DNA replication,"Enzymes are vital to the process of DNA replication, which would not begin or proceed without them. For example,
 separate enzymes manage the unzipping and rezipping of the two DNA strands. DNA polymerase is a complex of
 enzymes that selects and attaches the correct bases to the new strand and checks for errors at a rapid pace. Another
 enzyme manages the twisting tension of the double helix. Replication would not be possible without enzymes.","Enzymes play a crucial role in DNA replication by unwinding and unzipping the double helix structure, allowing the genetic material to be copied accurately. Helicase is an enzyme that breaks the hydrogen bonds between the two strands of DNA, while topoisomerase relaxes the supercoiled DNA molecule. DNA polymerase then reads the template strand and matches the incoming nucleotides to the base pairing rules, synthesizing a new complementary strand. This process ensures the faithful replication of genetic material during cell division.",0.653,0.662,0.658
31,Recall the names of the two cell division processes and define their main features.,"Mitosis—produces identical new cells for growth and repair
 Meiosis—produces sex cells (gametes) for sexual reproduction with a different combination of alleles to the parent cell","The two cell division processes are Mitosis and Meiosis. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues. Meiosis, on the other hand, is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four non-identical daughter cells with unique combinations of genetic traits.",0.531,0.636,0.579
32,Write a definition of ' species'.,"Members of the same species:
 • look alike (they are more alike in appearance than other organisms)
 • can interbreed in nature and their offspring are fertile (if they reproduce sexually)
 • cannot interbreed successfully with organisms outside their species group
 • have the same, or very similar, habitat requirements (i.e. have similar geographical distributions).","A species is a group of living organisms that share common characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. This definition encompasses all types of life, including plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. The concept of a species helps classify and categorize the vast diversity of life on Earth. It provides a fundamental framework for understanding the relationships between different organisms.",0.498,0.518,0.508
33,Examine the importance of cell division to a eukaryotic organism.,"Eukaryotes have two types of cell division—mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the basis of cell replication in unicellular
 eukaryotes. In multicellular eukaryotes, mitosis is used for growth, cell replacement and tissue repair. Meiosis is the
 basis of sexual reproduction in multicellular eukaryotes. It is essential to produce gametes, and enables two parents to
 contribute genetic information to the offspring and maintain genetic variation in new generations of offspring.","Cell division is crucial for the growth and development of eukaryotic organisms as it allows for the reproduction of cells that make up tissues and organs. This process enables the organism to repair damaged cells, replace old or worn-out cells, and maintain homeostasis. Additionally, cell division is essential for the production of gametes (sperm and egg cells) in multicellular eukaryotes, facilitating sexual reproduction and genetic diversity.",0.679,0.687,0.683
34,Examine some of the main differences in gene regulation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.,"In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA processing occur within the nucleus, while translation occurs in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex and can be regulated at any stage. In prokaryotic cells, gene expression consists only of transcription and translation, and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells (as prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles). Here, transcription and translation occur at almost the same time. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated during transcription.","In prokaryotic cells, genes are typically transcribed and translated simultaneously, with minimal post-transcriptional regulation. In contrast, eukaryotic cells have a more complex gene regulatory system, involving multiple layers of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control, including RNA splicing, editing, and degradation. Additionally, eukaryotic cells have a larger genome size and more complex chromatin structure, which affects gene expression. This complexity allows for greater flexibility in gene regulation and is thought to contribute to the increased diversity of eukaryotic organisms.",0.64,0.653,0.646
35,Explain why the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells can be seen under a light microscope but those of prokaryotes cannot,"The prokaryote chromosome contains only coding regions and no extra non-coding DNA. Also, a prokaryote is a
 simple single cell with many less genes. Eukaryote cells are more complex with many more genes and much longer
 DNA that includes a lot of introns. The extra amount of DNA will only fit into a nucleus if it is tightly condensed and
 super-coiled around histone proteins. This packaging makes eukaryotic DNA large enough to be visible as thread-like
 linear chromosomes when stained and viewed under a light microscope. The single prokaryote chromosome does not
 pack tightly together and is only visible as a dark nucleoid region.","The chromosomes of eukaryotic cells are visible under a light microscope because they are large and condensed during cell division. This condensation allows them to be stained with dyes, making them visible under the microscope. In contrast, prokaryotic cells have smaller, circular DNA molecules that are not condensed or organized into distinct chromosomes, making them invisible under a light microscope without special staining techniques.",0.688,0.614,0.649
36,Name the three types of RNA and outline their basic functions.,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries a copy of the nucleotide sequence of DNA that specifies the amino acid sequence for
 a protein. The mature mRNA travels from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it binds to ribosomes ready for translation.
 Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms a small organelle called a ribosome, which is the site at which the information in the
 mRNA is translated into a chain of amino acids.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules transfer amino acids from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes, where they are joined to
 form a polypeptide chain. The sequence of the chain is based on the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA.","The three main types of RNA are messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). mRNA carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. tRNA is responsible for transferring amino acids to the growing protein chain during translation, while rRNA makes up a large part of the ribosome itself and plays a crucial role in protein synthesis.",0.674,0.627,0.65
37,Identify the three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes.,"The three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes include: 
1. transcription which is the synthesis of mRNA
2. RNA processing, where the pre-mRNA is refined into mature mRNA
3. translation, as the polypeptide chain constructed at the ribosome from code on mature mRNA","The three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes are transcription, translation initiation, and elongation/termination. During transcription, a complementary RNA copy is made from the DNA template. In translation initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA and positions itself at the start codon (AUG). Elongation/termination involves the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain as the ribosome moves along the mRNA, with termination occurring when a stop codon is reached.",0.63,0.708,0.667
38,Outline the main structural features of eukaryotic genes and their functions.,"stop and start codons—regions at which encoding DNA begins and ends for a specific gene
 promoter regions—an upstream binding region for the enzyme that is involved in the encoding process
 (which is RNA polymerase)
 exons—DNA regions that are coding segments
 introns—DNA regions that are non-coding segments","Eukaryotic genes typically consist of a promoter region, an open reading frame (ORF), introns, exons, and a 3' untranslated region (UTR). The promoter region is responsible for initiating transcription, while the ORF encodes the protein sequence. Introns are non-coding regions that are removed during RNA splicing, whereas exons are coding regions that remain in the mature mRNA. The 3' UTR regulates gene expression and mRNA stability.",0.514,0.578,0.544
39,"Proteins are key components of cells. Outline, with
 examples, at least five different roles carried out by
 proteins.","Proteins have various functions in cells/organisms. They act as enzymes to catalyse all biochemical reactions, form structural components of cells and organs, are involved in movement (e.g. as contractile fibres in cells), are embedded in cell and organelle membranes as well as being involved in the transport of materials across membranes. They are also involved in the transport of substances such as oxygen in red blood cells by bonding to haemoglobin protein, for signal transduction, cell recognition, communication (e.g. as hormones like oestrogen) or antibodies involved in immune defence.","Proteins play a crucial role in various cellular functions. Here are five different roles carried out by proteins:

1. **Structural Role**: Proteins like collagen and keratin provide structural support to cells and tissues, giving them shape and rigidity.
2. **Enzymatic Role**: Enzymes such as lactase and amylase catalyze chemical reactions that break down nutrients into energy-producing molecules.
3. **Transportation Role**: Proteins like hemoglobin transport oxygen and other substances throughout the body, while proteins like albumin help regulate fluid balance.
4. **Signaling Role**: Proteins like hormones (e.g., insulin) and growth factors transmit signals between cells to coordinate various physiological processes.
5. **Defense Role**: Proteins like antibodies and complement proteins help protect against infections by recognizing and neutralizing pathogens.",0.548,0.636,0.589
40,Distinguish between the proteome and proteomics.,"A proteome is the complete set of proteins in an individual organism. Proteomics is the scientific study of the proteins, including the use of technologies that assist in studying and understanding proteins.","The proteome refers to the entire set of proteins expressed by an organism or system, while proteomics is the study of the proteome, involving the analysis of protein structure, function, and interactions. Proteomics encompasses various techniques such as mass spectrometry, chromatography, and bioinformatics to understand the complex relationships between proteins and their roles in biological processes. This field aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proteome's dynamics and its impact on cellular functions.",0.621,0.774,0.689
41,Compare fibrous and globular proteins,"Fibrous proteins are elongated with little or no tertiary folding, usually insoluble and have have structural roles like keratin in fingernails. Whilst globular proteins are compactly folded and coiled into spherical tertiary and quaternary structures, usually soluble such as enzymes and hormones are globular proteins.","Fibrous proteins have a long, rope-like structure and are typically found in connective tissue, hair, skin, and muscles. In contrast, globular proteins have a more compact, spherical shape and are often involved in cellular signaling, immune responses, and enzyme activity. The main difference between the two is their secondary and tertiary structure, with fibrous proteins having a high degree of alpha-helix content and globular proteins having a mix of alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures. This structural difference affects their function and properties.",0.583,0.626,0.604
42,Explain what is meant by a protein becoming 'denatured'.,"A protein is said to be denatured when the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces that create the tertiary structure of the protein are broken and the shape of the protein is altered.","When a protein becomes denatured, it means that its natural three-dimensional structure has been disrupted or unfolded, causing the protein's polypeptide chain to become random and lose its functional shape. This can occur due to various factors such as heat, pH changes, detergents, or other chemicals that alter the protein's native conformation. As a result, the denatured protein often loses its biological activity and function. Denaturation is typically reversible under mild conditions, but severe denaturation can lead to protein degradation or aggregation.",0.55,0.618,0.582
43,Outline the factors that can cause a protein to become denatured.,A protein is denatured when it is exposed to temperatures above its optimum temperature and sometimes when the protein is exposed to pH levels higher or lower than its optimum pH.,"Protein denaturation occurs due to various factors that disrupt its native conformation and secondary structure. These include high temperatures, exposure to chemicals such as detergents or solvents, changes in pH levels, mechanical stress, and the presence of denaturing agents like urea or guanidine. Additionally, radiation and oxidative stress can also cause protein denaturation by damaging its amino acid sequence. This leads to a loss of function and potentially toxic effects on cells.",0.485,0.59,0.532
44,Explain the difference between the genotype and phenotype of an individual.,A genotype is the combination of alleles that an individual has for the characteristic being investigated. The phenotype of the individual is the trait that a given genotype expresses. The environment also plays a role in the expression of the phenotype.,"The genotype of an individual refers to their complete set of genes, which is the genetic information encoded in their DNA. The phenotype, on the other hand, is the physical expression or manifestation of those genes, including traits such as eye color, hair texture, height, and other characteristics. In essence, the genotype is the genetic blueprint, while the phenotype is the actual physical appearance that results from the interaction of the genotype with environmental factors. This distinction is crucial in understanding how genetics influences an individual's characteristics.",0.578,0.7,0.633
45,Describe an example where an organism's phenotype can be affected by the environment in which it is raised.,"An example answer is—Flower colour in hydrangeas is affected by the pH of the soil,
 which affects the availability of aluminium in the soil to the plant. Therefore, plants with the same genotype can have
 different colour phenotypes.","The phenotype of a plant called Arabidopsis thaliani can be affected by the amount of light it receives. Plants grown in bright light conditions tend to have more leaves and grow taller, while those grown in low-light conditions may have fewer leaves and shorter stems. This difference in growth is an example of how environmental factors can influence an organism's phenotype. The plant's genetic makeup remains unchanged, but its physical characteristics are altered by the environment.",0.561,0.617,0.587
46,What is meant by the term 'monohybrid cross'?,Monohybrid crosses are crosses between two individuals with different alleles at a single genetic locus. These crosses are performed to determine which trait is dominant.,"A monohybrid cross refers to a genetic experiment where two individuals that are heterozygous for a specific trait are crossed to produce offspring. This type of cross involves one gene pair and allows researchers to study the inheritance pattern of a single gene or trait. The resulting offspring can exhibit different phenotypes, such as dominant or recessive traits, depending on their genotype.",0.594,0.73,0.655
47,What is the Law of Independent Assortment and what does it state?,"Mendel’s second law of inheritance, the Law of Independent Assortment, states that the alleles of a gene controlling one trait assort independently of alleles of another gene controlling a different trait.","The Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other. This means that the alleles of one gene do not influence the alleles of another gene during the process of meiosis, resulting in a random combination of alleles from each parent. As a result, offspring can inherit any possible combination of alleles from their parents, increasing genetic variation and diversity.",0.622,0.74,0.676
48,What are the possible outcomes of meiosis in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb? List all the gametes that this individual could produce.,"The possible outcomes of meiosis (gametes) in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb (for unlinked genes, or linked genes after crossing over) are AB, Ab, aB, ab.","In a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb, meiosis can result in four possible outcomes for each pair of alleles (A/a and B/b). The possible gametes are: AB, Ab, aB, and ab. This is because during meiosis, the alleles from each pair separate independently, resulting in all possible combinations.",0.659,0.755,0.704
49,List one way in which population genetics is useful for conservation purposes,Population genetics can be used to measure and monitor genetic variation in a population; track invasive species; and discover and define new species.,"Population genetics can be used to identify and prioritize species or populations that are most at risk of extinction due to genetic diversity loss, allowing conservation efforts to focus on the most vulnerable groups. This information can inform decisions about habitat protection, reintroduction programs, and management strategies to maintain healthy and resilient populations. By analyzing genetic data, scientists can also detect signs of inbreeding depression and other genetic issues that may impact a species' ability to adapt to changing environments.",0.535,0.739,0.621
50,List three characteristics of an ideal genetic marker and explain why they are necessary in population genetic analyses.,"The genetic marker must (1) be polymorphic in the population of interest, or it will not contain any useful information; (2) be a neutral marker (i.e. not under selection) as the analytical models usually assume random distribution of alleles; (3) be affordable and relatively easy to work with, as most projects have a limited budget.","An ideal genetic marker should have high polymorphism, which allows for the detection of multiple alleles within a population. It should also be highly heritable, meaning that it is influenced by genetics rather than environmental factors. Additionally, an ideal genetic marker should be easily and accurately scored, allowing for precise measurement and analysis. These characteristics are necessary in population genetic analyses to ensure accurate and reliable conclusions about population structure and dynamics.",0.598,0.556,0.576
51,Define 'genetic testing'.,"Genetic testing is a medical test used to detect specific alleles, mutations, genotypes or karyotypes that are associated with heritable traits, diseases or predispositions to diseases.","Genetic testing is a medical test used to identify genetic variations that can cause or increase the risk of developing certain diseases or conditions. It involves analyzing an individual's DNA to detect specific genetic mutations or changes in their genes. This type of testing can be used for diagnostic, predictive, or carrier testing purposes.",0.671,0.678,0.674
52,What are the three main m ethodologies used in genetic sequencing and profiling?,Molecular genetic testing; cytogenetic testing-karyotyping and molecular cytogenetic testing via fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH); biochemical genetic testing.,"The three main methodologies used in genetic sequencing and profiling are Sanger Sequencing, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Sanger Sequencing is a traditional method that involves the use of dideoxynucleotides to terminate DNA synthesis at specific points. NGS, on the other hand, uses high-throughput sequencing technologies such as Illumina and Ion Torrent to sequence millions of DNA fragments in parallel. PCR is a laboratory technique used to amplify specific segments of DNA for further analysis or sequencing.",0.449,0.52,0.482
53,What is an STR? List the steps for determining a DNA profile by STR analysis.,"An STR is a short tandem repeat. They are short repeat sequences of DNA scattered throughout the genome. 
To make a DNA profile: 
• extract DNA from a tissue sample 
• amplify the STRs using PCR (different primers for different STRs) 
• run the PCR products on a gel or capillary electrophoresis 
• compare the bands on a gel or the peaks on the graph.","An STR (Short Tandem Repeat) refers to a type of genetic marker used in DNA profiling.

To determine a DNA profile by STR analysis, follow these steps:

1. Collect and extract DNA from a biological sample such as blood, saliva, or tissue.
2. Amplify the STR regions using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).
3. Separate the amplified STR fragments using capillary electrophoresis or gel electrophoresis to determine their lengths.
4. Compare the resulting STR profiles with known profiles in a database to identify potential matches.",0.683,0.742,0.711
54,What was the original goal of the Human Genome Project?,"The original goal was to determine the complete human genome, the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA
 molecule and the number of genes in one human individual.","The primary objective of the Human Genome Project was to sequence and map the entire human genome within a period of 15 years, with an estimated completion date in 2005. The project aimed to identify all approximately 20,000-25,000 genes that make up the human genome and determine their positions on the chromosomes. This endeavor was expected to lead to significant advances in understanding human biology and disease, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare and treatments.",0.558,0.658,0.604
55,List two reasons that genetic variation is important for the long-term survival of a gene pool.,"Genetic variation means that populations are more able to adapt to changes and challenges in the environment, because natural selection acts upon genetic variation. Genetic variation acts as a buffer against the accumulation of dangerous mutations, as it reduces the chances of inbreeding.","Genetic variation allows a population to adapt to changing environments and increases its chances of survival in the face of disease or environmental stressors. Additionally, genetic variation provides a reservoir of traits that can be selected upon by natural selection, enabling populations to evolve and improve their fitness over time. This diversity also reduces the risk of extinction due to a single catastrophic event affecting all individuals with similar traits.",0.663,0.713,0.687
56,Why are frameshift mutations more significant than substitution point mutations?,A substitution mutation only alters one codon; a frameshift mutation alters every codon after the mutation.,"Frameshift mutations can lead to the creation of a completely new protein sequence or result in a non-functional protein due to the disruption of the reading frame. This is because even a single nucleotide insertion or deletion can cause all subsequent codons to be misread, leading to a significant alteration in the final protein product. In contrast, substitution point mutations typically only replace one amino acid with another, which may have less severe consequences for the overall function of the protein. As a result, frameshift mutations are often more significant than substitution point mutations.",0.511,0.703,0.592
57,2 Explain why silent mutations are called 'silent'.,"Silent mutations are silent because they do not change the amino acid that they code for, and as such they have no functional change in terms of protein products.","Silent mutations occur when a change in DNA sequence does not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. This is because the genetic code is degenerate, meaning that more than one codon can code for the same amino acid. As a result, some mutations may not affect the final protein product and are therefore considered ""silent"".",0.616,0.703,0.657
58,state which chromosome is affected and whether the chromosome is in excess or missing. a Down syndrome,chromosome 21; one additional copy (trisomy 21),"The chromosome affected in Down syndrome is Chromosome 21. It is present in excess, typically with an extra copy of this chromosome (trisomy 21). This results in an individual having 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. The extra genetic material from Chromosome 21 leads to the characteristic features and developmental delays associated with Down syndrome.",0.461,0.75,0.571
59,What is a neoplasm?,A neoplasm is a mass of tissue formed by uncontrolled cell division.,"A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of cells that can be benign or malignant. Neoplasms, also known as tumors, occur when cells divide and grow uncontrollably due to genetic mutations or other factors. This uncontrolled growth can lead to the formation of a mass or lump in various parts of the body.",0.594,0.797,0.68
60,Give two examples of each of the following: a sources of chemical mutagens b physical mutagens c biological mutagen,"a Sources of chemical mutagens—acceptable answers include mustard gas, ethidium bromide, chemicals contained in tobacco, outdoor air pollution, coffee, nuts, tomatoes, pineapples, herbs, spices, mushrooms, cadmium and arsenic. b Physical mutagens—acceptable answers include particle radiation: nuclear fission, nuclear fusion; high energy electromagnetic radiation (EMR): X-rays, gamma rays and high energy ultraviolet light. c Biological mutagens—acceptable answers include oncoviruses (direct or indirect) such as HTLV-1 and human papillomavirus (HPV) and transposable elements (TEs, transposons).","Here are the examples:

a. Sources of chemical mutagens:
1. Benzene
2. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)

b. Physical mutagens:
1. Ultraviolet (UV) light
2. Ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays)

c. Biological mutagen:
1. Viruses (e.g., HIV)
2. Bacteria (e.g., E. coli with a mutator gene)",0.608,0.584,0.595
61,Explain how proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes can cause cancer.,"Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell growth. When these genes are unregulated, cell growth increases, causing tumours/ cancers/neoplasms. Tumour-suppressor genes inhibit cell division. If these genes are damaged, cell division can go unregulated, causing tumours/cancers/neoplasms","Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that can become oncogenic (cancer-causing) when mutated or overexpressed. When these genes are activated, they promote cell growth and division, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and potentially resulting in cancer. On the other hand, tumour-suppressor genes normally prevent cells from growing uncontrollably by repairing DNA damage and initiating apoptosis (cell death). Mutations in these genes can lead to a loss of function, allowing damaged cells to survive and proliferate, contributing to cancer development.",0.616,0.691,0.651
62,Is the following statement true or false? Mutations to non-coding regions of ONA will not have an effect on the organism. Explain your answer.,False. These mutations interfere with the transcription process; a gene could become partially or entirely non-functional.,"The statement is FALSE. Non-coding regions of DNA, including those within genes (introns) and outside of genes (intergenic regions), can still influence gene expression and regulation through various mechanisms such as enhancers, silencers, and other regulatory elements. Mutations to these non-coding regions can disrupt normal gene function and have significant effects on the organism.",0.477,0.605,0.533
63,Describe the process by which intrans are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule during transcription.,"During the transcription process, the introns (which do not code for proteins) must be removed to create functional mRNA. The removal is known as splicing and requires a protein complex known as a spliceosome. The spliceosome is made up of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles or snRNPs. This spliceosome binds to three recognised sequences along the intron: one at the 5′ end (known as the 5′ junction) one at the 3′ end (the 3′ junction) and one near the 3′ end (the branch point) that allows the intron to fold into a loop before it is removed. After the intron is removed, the exons can join together to create an mRNA molecule with a neat, continuous coding sequence","Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule through a process called RNA splicing. During transcription, the pre-mRNA molecule contains both introns and exons. The spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and proteins, recognizes the intron-exon boundaries and cleaves the pre-mRNA at these sites, removing the introns and joining the exons together to form a mature mRNA molecule. This process is essential for producing functional mRNAs that can be translated into proteins.",0.692,0.63,0.66
64,What is a deep intronic mutation?,A deep intronic mutation is a mutation that is located more than 100 nucleotides from the 5′ or 3′ junctions between the intron and the exon.,"A deep intronic mutation is a type of genetic mutation that occurs within the non-coding regions of a gene, specifically in the deep introns. Deep introns are the largest and most conserved parts of a gene's intron structure, located farthest from the protein-coding exons. These mutations can disrupt the normal splicing process, leading to aberrant RNA transcripts that may be detrimental to cellular function.",0.576,0.664,0.617
65,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a germ cell? Give an example of each.,"Somatic cells are all the cells in the body of an organism, apart from the gametes (egg and sperm cells). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells","Somatic cells are non-reproductive cells that make up the majority of the body's tissues and organs, such as skin, muscle, and blood cells. Germ cells, on the other hand, are reproductive cells that give rise to gametes (sperm or egg cells). An example of a somatic cell is a red blood cell, which carries oxygen throughout the body. An example of a germ cell is an oocyte (egg cell), which develops into a fertilized egg during reproduction.",0.618,0.771,0.686
66,Explain how an error in meiosis can lead to Down syndrome.,"An error in meiosis is caused by non-disjunction of chromosomes/chromatids, where chromosomes/chromatids do not separate. Non-disjunction can occur between homologous chromosomes during anaphase I or between chromatids during anaphase II. Errors in meiosis occur during gamete (sperm or egg) formation. Down syndrome is due to an extra chromosome 21 where a gamete receives two copies of chromosome 21. As a result the zygote (offspring) has three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) instead of two and a total of 47 chromosomes instead of 46.","During meiosis, a process that occurs in reproductive cells, errors can occur when chromosomes don't separate properly. This can result in an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is the cause of Down syndrome. The extra genetic material disrupts normal cell function and development, leading to the characteristic features of Down syndrome. This error is often due to a non-disjunction event during meiosis, where the homologous chromosomes fail to separate correctly.",0.665,0.591,0.626
67,Why is polyploidy more common in plants than animals?,"Polyploidy is more common in plants than animals because many plants can reproduce by asexual reproduction. For example, a triploid plant (3n) is typically sterile or has low fertility because of problems with chromosome pairing during meiosis and gamete formation. But it could survive by vegetative reproduction. Fewer complex animals can reproduce asexually, so polyploidy that results in sterility is less common.","Polyploidy is more common in plants than animals because it provides a mechanism for rapid evolution and adaptation in plant species. In plants, polyploidy can occur through the fusion of two or more complete sets of chromosomes, which can lead to increased genetic diversity and flexibility. This allows plants to better respond to changing environmental conditions and compete with other organisms for resources. As a result, polyploidy has been observed in approximately 36% of flowering plant species.",0.651,0.619,0.635
68,Define the term 'biotechnology'.,"Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary technology, which uses biological processes and organisms to create new products and develop new technologies.","Biotechnology is the use of biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to develop new products, technologies, and medical treatments. It involves the application of scientific principles to manipulate and engineer biological processes for practical purposes. This field combines biology, chemistry, and engineering disciplines to create innovative solutions in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental science. Biotechnology has led to numerous breakthroughs in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.",0.584,0.78,0.668
69,Define the term 'selective breeding' and provide an example of its application in ancient times.,"Selective breeding is a process where the animals or plants that express desired characteristics are bred together to produce offspring that will also show these characteristics. Examples will vary but may include horses, which have been bred for different uses such as ploughing, racing and dressage.","Selective breeding is a process where animals or plants are bred to emphasize specific desirable traits, such as size, color, or productivity. This is achieved by carefully selecting individuals with the desired characteristics and mating them to produce offspring that inherit those traits. In ancient times, selective breeding was practiced in ancient Egypt around 2500 BC, where they selectively bred cats for their distinctive coat patterns and colors, resulting in a wide range of domesticated cat breeds.",0.63,0.675,0.652
70,Identify the significant scientific event that marked the commencement of modern biotechnology.,The discovery of DNA.,"The discovery of DNA's double helix structure by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 is considered a significant scientific event that marked the commencement of modern biotechnology. This breakthrough led to a deeper understanding of genetic material and paved the way for advances in genetic engineering, gene editing, and other biotechnological fields. The discovery also laid the foundation for the development of recombinant DNA technology, which has had a profound impact on various industries, including medicine, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. This event is widely regarded as a turning point in the history of biotechnology.",0.389,0.65,0.487
71,Describe the positive social impacts of the GM crop Golden Rice.,"Answers may vary but could include: improved health and nutrition to some of the poorest communities, reduced vitamin A deficiency in some of the poorest communities, the success of Golden Rice has promoted the development of further GM crops.","Golden Rice is a genetically modified crop that produces beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. This innovation has the potential to address vitamin A deficiency in developing countries, particularly among children and women, reducing the risk of night blindness, weakened immune systems, and even death. By providing a natural source of vitamin A, Golden Rice can improve overall health, boost cognitive function, and support economic development through increased crop yields and food security. This can lead to improved educational outcomes and reduced poverty rates in affected communities.",0.55,0.582,0.566
72,Explain why a religion or culture may oppose the use of transgenic animals.,"Some religions restrict certain foods. While a transgenic animal may appear to be of one species, it may contain some genetic elements of species, which members of different religious groups choose not to eat. Some cultures may also have ethical reasons for opposing the use of transgenic animals.","Some religions and cultures may view the creation of transgenic animals as tampering with nature's design, which can be seen as a form of hubris or disrespect for the natural order. This perspective may lead to opposition based on spiritual or philosophical grounds. Additionally, concerns about the potential unintended consequences of genetic modification on ecosystems and human health may also contribute to resistance against transgenic animals. These views often prioritize traditional values over scientific advancements.",0.557,0.644,0.597
73,Describe how genetic variation can benefit agricultural biotechnology.,"Genetic variation improves the evolutionary potential of populations, species, cultivars and breeds of organisms. This improves their long-term stability and the potential to develop new plant cultivars and animal breeds.","Genetic variation can benefit agricultural biotechnology by providing a diverse range of traits and characteristics that can be used to improve crop yields, disease resistance, and nutritional content. This variation can be exploited through techniques such as marker-assisted selection and gene editing, allowing scientists to identify and introduce desirable genes into crops. By leveraging genetic diversity, researchers can develop more resilient and productive agricultural products, ultimately contributing to global food security. This approach also enables the creation of novel crop varieties with improved traits.",0.553,0.613,0.582
74,Explain how the increased use of a species for biotechnology could cause biodiversity loss.,"If a species is increasingly used for biotechnology, its value rises. This could lead to overexploitation and endangerment of the species.","The increased use of a species for biotechnology can lead to over-harvesting and exploitation, depleting wild populations and potentially driving them towards extinction. This can disrupt ecosystems and have cascading effects on other species that depend on the affected species for food, shelter, or other resources. Furthermore, the focus on a single species for biotechnology applications can divert attention and resources away from conservation efforts for other species, exacerbating biodiversity loss. As a result, the long-term sustainability of biotechnology applications may be compromised by the very species they rely on.",0.555,0.687,0.614
75,Differentiate between in situ and ex situ conservation methods.,"In situ practices maintain the organism in its natural environment, whereas ex situ methods conserve organisms outside of their natural environment (e.g. in zoos).","In situ conservation involves protecting and preserving species or ecosystems within their natural habitats, minimizing human intervention. Ex situ conservation, on the other hand, involves removing species or genetic material from their natural habitat for protection and breeding in controlled environments such as zoos, botanical gardens, or seed banks. This allows for more direct management and control over the conserved resources. Ex situ methods are often used to supplement in situ efforts.",0.549,0.701,0.616
76,Define the term 'artificial insemination',Artificial insemination is a reproductive technology that involves the deliberate introduction of male sperm into the female reproductive tract by a method other than sexual intercourse.,"Artificial insemination is a reproductive technology where sperm is collected from a male and inserted into a female's reproductive tract using a specialized instrument, rather than through natural mating. This method allows for controlled breeding and can be used in various contexts, including animal husbandry and human fertility treatments. The process involves collecting and storing the sperm, then depositing it into the female's vagina or uterus to facilitate fertilization.",0.617,0.79,0.693
77,What advantages does artificial insemination bring to agriculture?,"Answers may vary but could include: • multiple females can be impregnated from one sample • females in different geographic locations to the male can be impregnated • farmers don’t have to keep male animals on their property • avoids behavioural challenges associated with mating animals • reproductive health of population protected through screening of semen samples • requires no animal-to-animal contact, avoiding the spread of disease.","Artificial insemination (AI) brings several advantages to agriculture, including increased genetic diversity, improved fertility rates, and reduced labor costs associated with natural breeding. AI also allows for the selection of high-quality sires and control over breeding programs, leading to enhanced livestock productivity and quality. Additionally, AI reduces the risk of disease transmission and minimizes the need for repeated breeding attempts, resulting in more efficient and effective farming practices. This leads to increased crop yields and improved overall farm efficiency.",0.501,0.474,0.487
78,How does artificial insemination differ from in vitro fertilisation (IVF)?,Artificial insemination involves the delivery of semen directly into the female reproductive system. Whereas IVF removes the egg from the female and fertilises it with the sperm in a laboratory setting prior to returning the fertilised egg back into the female uterus.,"Artificial insemination involves the insertion of a sperm sample into a female's reproductive tract, with the goal of achieving fertilization naturally. In contrast, IVF requires the retrieval of eggs from the ovaries and their fertilization outside the body using a sperm sample, followed by the transfer of the resulting embryo to the uterus. This process bypasses natural fertilization altogether. As such, IVF is generally considered more invasive than artificial insemination.",0.666,0.732,0.697
79,What is artificial twinning? How does it differ from the birth of natural identical twins?,"Artificial twinning splits an embryo in two very early in the development process. Both halves of the embryo continue to divide leading to two separate individuals with identical genetic make-up. Artificial embryo twinning differs from natural identical twin development as it is carried out in a laboratory petri dish, with the early embryo artificially separated into individual cells and allowed to continue dividing. The embryos are then transferred into a surrogate mother.","Artificial twinning, also known as reproductive cloning, is a process where an embryo is created in a laboratory and implanted into a woman's uterus to carry a pregnancy. This differs significantly from the birth of natural identical twins, which occurs when a single fertilized egg splits in two and develops into two separate embryos, each with its own unique DNA. Artificial twinning involves creating a genetically identical copy of an individual, whereas natural identical twins share the same genetic material but have some minor differences due to environmental influences during fetal development. This process is still considered highly experimental and raises complex ethical concerns.",0.609,0.643,0.626
80,Explain the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer.,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves the removal of chromosomes from an egg cell and replaces them with the nucleus of a somatic cell taken from the organism being cloned. The egg cell is then induced to divide. Once the embryo has developed, it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate female organism. The individual that is born following gestation will be an identical genetic copy of the animal from which the original somatic cell was taken.","Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory technique used to create an embryo by transferring the nucleus from an adult cell into an egg cell that has had its own nucleus removed. The adult cell's DNA is then reprogrammed to resemble that of an embryonic cell, allowing it to develop into a blastocyst. This process involves several steps, including enucleation of the egg, nuclear extraction from the adult cell, and fusion of the two cells using an electrical pulse or other method. The resulting embryo can be used for research or potentially for reproductive purposes.",0.612,0.665,0.637
81,Describe the term 'gene therapy'.,Gene therapy refers to the insertion of a gene into an individual’s cells to correct or replace defective gene function that leads to disease.,"Gene therapy is a medical treatment that uses genes to prevent or treat diseases. It involves introducing healthy copies of a gene into cells to replace faulty or missing ones, thereby correcting genetic defects and restoring normal cellular function. This approach can be used to treat various conditions, including inherited disorders, cancer, and viral infections. Gene therapy aims to provide a long-term cure by modifying the genes that cause disease.",0.61,0.738,0.668
82,What types of human proteins are commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology?,"Human proteins commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology are hormones, enzymes, vaccines and cytokines.","Human proteins commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology include insulin, growth hormone, and interferons. Additionally, enzymes such as lyase and proteases like thrombin are also produced through this method. Other examples include erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a cytokine involved in immune responses. These proteins have various therapeutic applications.",0.577,0.855,0.689
83,What is a plasmid? Describe the role played by plasmids in gene cloning.,"A plasmid is a circular molecule of bacterial DNA. Plasmids are useful in gene cloning. They replicate frequently within the bacterial cell. When a foreign gene such as the human insulin gene is inserted into bacterial plasmids and the bacteria are cultured, large amounts of the protein (insulin) can be produced by the bacteria.","A plasmid is a small, self-replicating circular DNA molecule that can be found in bacteria and some other organisms. In gene cloning, plasmids serve as vectors to carry and replicate foreign DNA fragments, allowing researchers to manipulate and study specific genes or genetic sequences. Plasmids are often used to introduce new genes into host cells, enabling the expression of desired proteins or traits. This process is a crucial step in molecular biology research and biotechnology applications.",0.642,0.69,0.665
84,Describe a genetically modified organism and compare it to a transgenic organism.,"A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism that has an alteration to one or more genes due to gene transfer, mutagenesis or gene editing. Transgenic organisms are a subset of GMOs; they have a gene from a different source inserted into their genome (e.g. a plant with a bacterial insecticide gene, a mouse with a human antibody gene, or a goat with a spider silk protein gene).","A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This can involve the introduction of genes from one species into another, or the modification of existing genes within an organism. A transgenic organism, on the other hand, refers specifically to an organism that has been engineered to express a gene from another species. In essence, all transgenic organisms are GMOs, but not all GMOs are necessarily transgenic.",0.663,0.621,0.641
85,Identify two advantages of artificial insemination for human fertility treatment,Artificial insemination is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive procedure.,"Artificial insemination (AI) offers several benefits in human fertility treatment. Two significant advantages include increased sperm count and motility, allowing for a higher chance of successful fertilization. Additionally, AI reduces the risk of transmitting infectious diseases from one partner to another during natural conception. This method also provides an opportunity for couples to use donor sperm if they have difficulty conceiving due to male factor infertility.",0.461,0.629,0.532
86,Define the term 'xenotransplantation'.,"Xenotransplantation involves the transplantation of cells, tissues or organs from a donor species to a different species (e.g. from a non-human donor species to a human).","Xenotransplantation refers to the transplantation of living cells, tissues, or organs from one species into another species. This can include transplanting organs such as kidneys, hearts, and livers from animals into humans. The goal is to provide a source of compatible donor organs for patients in need of transplants, particularly those with rare or hard-to-match human donors.",0.66,0.781,0.715
87,Provide an example of a therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology in medicine.,Answers may vary but could include: • epidermal growth factor used in the treatment of burns to improve the survival of skin grafts • interleukin-2 used in cancer treatment • antibodies for immunotherapy • vaccines against a number of viruses.,"One notable example is the production of human insulin using recombinant DNA technology. This involves inserting the gene that codes for human insulin into bacteria such as E. coli, which then produce the protein. The resulting insulin is identical to natural human insulin and can be used to treat diabetes. This application has revolutionized the treatment of diabetes by providing a more effective and safer alternative to animal-derived insulins.",0.454,0.467,0.46
88,Outline the chain of infection.,infectious agent → reservoir → portal of exit → mode of transmission → portal of entry → susceptible host,"The chain of infection is a series of steps that must be present for an infectious disease to occur. It consists of six links: a susceptible host, a pathogen (such as bacteria or virus), a portal of entry (where the pathogen enters the body), a vehicle (which carries the pathogen), a reservoir (where the pathogen is stored), and a mode of transmission (how the pathogen is spread).",0.438,0.635,0.519
89,Name three portals of exit in human hosts,"Respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract or skin","The three main portals of exit in human hosts are the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. These organs allow for the elimination of waste products and foreign substances from the body. The skin is responsible for sweating and shedding dead cells, while the lungs expel carbon dioxide through exhalation. The gastrointestinal tract eliminates solid waste through defecation.",0.412,0.609,0.491
90,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in a population of an area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.","An epidemic refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease within a specific geographic area, such as a city or region. A pandemic, on the other hand, is a widespread outbreak of a disease that affects multiple countries and often involves international travel and global spread. In essence, an epidemic is contained within a smaller area, while a pandemic has a much broader reach. This distinction highlights the severity and potential impact of a disease outbreak.",0.671,0.767,0.716
91,Compare germ theory to the theory of spontaneous generation.,Germ theory replaced spontaneous generation as the explanation for the occurrence and transmission of disease. Spontaneous generation states that life can arise from non-living matter while germ theory states that life comes from existing living matter.,"Germ theory proposes that microorganisms cause disease, whereas the theory of spontaneous generation suggests that living organisms can arise from non-living matter. These two theories are fundamentally opposed, with germ theory being widely accepted and spontaneous generation being disproven through scientific experiments. The discovery of microorganisms by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 provided key evidence for germ theory, while Louis Pasteur's swan-neck flask experiment in 1859 discredited the idea of spontaneous generation. This led to a significant shift in understanding disease causation and prevention.",0.537,0.76,0.629
92,What are Koch's four postulates?,"1 The microorganism must be present in the tissues of the infected organism and not in a healthy organism. 2 The microorganism must be able to be cultivated in isolation from the infected organism. 3 When an uninfected organism is then inoculated with the culture, it should develop symptoms of the disease. 4 Samples from the second infected organism should be able to be isolated and found to be the same as the microorganism from the first infected organism.","Koch's four postulates are a set of criteria used to establish a causal relationship between a microorganism and a disease. They were first proposed by Robert Koch in 1884 and are still widely used today. The postulates state that for a microorganism to be considered the cause of a disease, it must: (1) be found in all organisms suffering from the disease but not in healthy ones; (2) be isolated from the diseased organism and grown in a pure culture; (3) when this cultured microbe is returned to a healthy organism, it must cause the same disease; and (4) the microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.",0.587,0.71,0.643
93,Explain one limitation of Koch's postulates.,answers should include either: asymptomatic carriers do not meet postulate 1; pathogens such as viruses that cannot be cultured and so do not meet postulates 2 and 3.,"Koch's postulates have been widely used to establish a causal relationship between a microorganism and a disease. However, one limitation is that they are not applicable in cases where the pathogen is an obligate intracellular parasite or a virus, as these organisms cannot be grown on artificial media, making it difficult to fulfill the first postulate. This limitation has been particularly relevant in the study of viral diseases.",0.46,0.521,0.489
94,Give two examples of pathogens that cause disease in plants,"Student answers may vary. The following are some examples: Phytophthora infestans, which causes potato blight; Fusarium oxysporum, the cause of Panama disease; Phytophthora cinnamomi, the cause of root rot or dieback disease.","The Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and the fungal pathogen Phytophthora infestans are two examples of pathogens that cause significant diseases in plants. TMV is a viral pathogen that causes mosaic-like symptoms on tobacco and other solanaceous crops, while P. infestans is a water mold that causes late blight disease in potatoes and tomatoes. These pathogens can lead to substantial yield losses and economic damage if not managed properly. They are also known to cause significant stress to plant populations worldwide.",0.537,0.611,0.572
95,What is a zoonotic disease? Give an example of this type of disease.,"A zoonotic disease is a disease that has passed from an animal host to a human. An example is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, which can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).","A zoonotic disease is an illness that can be transmitted from animals to humans. This type of disease can spread through various means such as bites, scratches, contact with infected bodily fluids, or consumption of contaminated food and water. An example of a zoonotic disease is rabies, which is caused by a virus found in infected mammals like dogs, cats, and bats.",0.623,0.619,0.621
96,Describe antigenic variation. What is the purpose of this adaptation in pathogens?,"Antigenic variation is the ability of pathogens to change their antigens (molecules on cells/pathogen surface that can induce an immune response in the host). Antigenic variation allows the pathogen to avoid recognition by the host’s immune system upon secondary exposure, giving the pathogen more time to colonise its host","Antigenic variation is a mechanism used by some pathogens, such as certain viruses and bacteria, to evade the host's immune system. This adaptation involves changing the surface proteins or antigens on the pathogen's surface, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and target them consistently. The purpose of antigenic variation is to allow the pathogen to persist in the host by avoiding neutralization and elimination by the immune response. This enables the pathogen to continue infecting and replicating, potentially leading to prolonged or recurrent infections.",0.674,0.751,0.711
97,Briefly describe how HIV overcomes the host's immune response.,HIV uses the host’s T lymphocytes which direct coordination of the immune response. HIV has a protein on its surface that binds to receptors on T lymphocytes and hijacks those cells to make replicates of the virus.,"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) overcomes the host's immune response by targeting and destroying CD4+ T cells, which are a crucial part of the immune system. The virus uses its envelope protein to fuse with the host cell membrane, releasing its genetic material into the cell. Once inside, HIV replicates rapidly, producing large quantities of viral particles that can infect other cells. This leads to a gradual decline in CD4+ T cell numbers, weakening the immune system and making it difficult for the body to fight off infections.",0.588,0.661,0.623
98,How does sneezing advance transmission of pathogens?,Some pathogens have adaptations that cause the host to produce extra mucus and cause discomfort resulting in sneezing. Sneezing can spread pathogens much faster and further to susceptible hosts than through direct skin-to-skin contact.,"Sneezing can advance the transmission of pathogens by propelling droplets containing viruses and bacteria into the air at high speeds, potentially infecting others who are in close proximity. These droplets can travel up to 20 feet or more, increasing the risk of transmission. The forceful expulsion of mucus and saliva during a sneeze can also spread pathogens on surfaces and objects, allowing for further transmission. This is especially concerning in crowded areas or among people with weakened immune systems.",0.556,0.608,0.581
99,Distinguish between disease caused by viruses and those caused by bacteria.,Viral pathogens rely on their viral envelope and capsid to penetrate host cells. Once a virus infects a host plant it can either result in a localised infection or it can move apoplastically or symplastically through the plant to become a systemic infection. Bacteria enter host plants via the stomata or other small wounds/openings. Once they have infected the plant they can move apoplastically to travel around the plant.,"Diseases caused by viruses typically have a more rapid onset of symptoms, are often contagious, and may not respond well to antibiotics. In contrast, diseases caused by bacteria tend to develop more gradually, can also be contagious, but usually respond to antibiotic treatment. Viral infections often involve the respiratory or gastrointestinal systems, while bacterial infections can affect various parts of the body.",0.523,0.52,0.522
100,Determine how you would distinguish between a healthy and a diseased plant,"Observing the colour and appearance of a plant is essential to determining whether the plant is healthy or unhealthy. Healthy plants typically exhibit stems which are straight and not wilted, leaves which are of a dark green colour and not discoloured or misshapen. Flowers of healthy plants are brightly coloured and plentiful. Healthy plants do not have lesions or other abnormal growths and may have multiple stems which are thicker. Unhealthy plants on the other hand exhibit discolouration in leaves and stems and flowers are not present or are very few. Plants that are suffering from disease may also exhibit wilting, dieback and organ deformities (leaf curling and excessive growths) especially when infections produce galls and other lesions.","To distinguish between a healthy and a diseased plant, look for signs of vigor and vitality in the healthy plant, such as robust growth, vibrant green color, and absence of pests or diseases. In contrast, a diseased plant may exhibit symptoms like yellowing or browning leaves, wilting, or presence of visible pathogens like fungi, bacteria, or insects. Healthy plants also tend to have strong root systems and produce new growth, whereas diseased plants often show stunted or deformed growth patterns. A visual inspection can help identify these differences.",0.622,0.606,0.614
101,List at least three physical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals,The physical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry are: • skin—which prevents entry of pathogens into the body • cilia—help to move mucus and other debris into the stomach or out of the body • peristalsis—aids in the movement of secretions (mucus) or foreign invaders to the stomach to kill pathogenic organisms.,"Physical barriers such as skin, mucous membranes, and feathers can prevent pathogen entry into animals by providing a protective layer against external pathogens. The skin acts as a physical barrier to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Mucous membranes in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts also serve as a physical barrier to prevent viral and bacterial infections.",0.598,0.581,0.589
102,List at least three chemical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals.,"The chemical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry into an animal are typically bodily secretions such as: • mucus—a sticky substance that traps pathogens and other foreign matter that enters the body • sebum—an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands that make the skin slightly acidic to prevent pathogenic organisms from growing on the skin and entering the body • cerumen—an oily waxy substance produced by the glands in the ear canal that helps to trap foreign substances and pathogens • acidic secretions (stomach, urogenital)—provide an acidic environment which pathogens are unable to tolerate and aid in the destruction of pathogenic organisms • lacrimal secretions—produced by the tear ducts they contain enzymes and other substances that break down bacterial cell walls and prevent infection by washing away debris and other foreign matter • lysozymes—enzymes found in secretions such as saliva, mucus and tears. This enzyme breaks down bacterial cell walls","Mucous membranes lining the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts serve as a physical barrier against pathogens. The skin also acts as a protective barrier, preventing direct contact between pathogens and internal tissues. Additionally, the acidic pH of the stomach helps to denature proteins on the surface of many pathogens, making it difficult for them to adhere to and infect host cells.",0.583,0.501,0.539
103,How are microflora necessary for the health of an animal?,"Microflora are beneficial bacteria that inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, throat, lower part of the gastrointestinal tract and the urogenital tract in healthy individuals. Microflora plays an important role in keeping pathogenic organisms from inhabiting an animal. The presence of microflora prevents the growth and colonisation of other bacteria because microflora compete with pathogenic bacteria for space and resources, and produce chemicals that reduce the pH of the micro-environment.","Microflora play a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and well-being of animals by aiding in digestion, synthesizing essential vitamins, and supporting the immune system. They help break down complex nutrients, absorb minerals, and produce short-chain fatty acids that provide energy to the host animal. A balanced microflora is also essential for preventing diseases and promoting a healthy gut microbiome. This, in turn, contributes to the overall health and vitality of the animal.",0.588,0.612,0.6
104,Outline the main components of the innate immune system,"The main components of the innate immune system are a number of specialised types of white blood cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells), a number of proteins and enzymes (e.g. lysozymes, cytokines, and complement proteins), inflammatory responses (involving histamines and prostaglandins), and apoptosis (programmed cell death).","The innate immune system consists of physical barriers such as skin and mucous membranes, cells like neutrophils and macrophages that engulf foreign particles, and proteins like complement that help eliminate pathogens. Additionally, the innate immune system includes the activation of inflammatory responses to combat infection. The main components also include dendritic cells that process and present antigens to T-cells, and natural killer cells that directly kill infected cells or tumor cells. These components work together to provide immediate defense against infections.",0.627,0.642,0.634
105,Phagocytes are important cells of the innate immune system. What is the function of some phagocytes that links the innate and adaptive immune systems?,"Some phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes. It is this antigen presentation that links the innate and adaptive immune systems.","Some phagocytes, such as dendritic cells, play a crucial role in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems by processing and presenting antigens to T-cells, thereby initiating an adaptive immune response. This process involves the engulfment of pathogens or foreign particles, followed by the presentation of their components to T-cells, which then triggers a specific immune response. Dendritic cells act as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses.",0.625,0.75,0.682
106,Distinguish between neutrophils and macrophages.,"This information may be presented in a table and diagrams drawn for further distinguishable features of both cells. Neutrophils are one of the most abundant white blood cells and a type of phagocyte. They can be distinguished by vesicles within their cytoplasm, which contain antimicrobial proteins to destroy pathogenic organisms. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and may live for a few hours. Macrophages on the other hand are matured monocytes. Macrophages work by ingesting pathogens in a phagosome. The cell membrane of the macrophage then binds with a lysosome (containing digestive enzymes) that dissolves the contents of the phagosome. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells and aid in the recognition of an invader by initiating T and B lymphocytes to be released. Macrophages may live for several months engulfing pathogenic organisms.","Neutrophils and macrophages are both types of white blood cells that play crucial roles in the immune system. Neutrophils are primarily involved in acute inflammation, fighting off bacterial infections, and are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days. Macrophages, on the other hand, are longer-lived, often persisting for weeks or even months, and are responsible for engulfing foreign particles, dead cells, and bacteria, as well as participating in chronic inflammation and tissue repair.",0.65,0.564,0.604
107,Which MHC class interacts with helper T lymphocytes. and which interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes?,MHC-II interacts with helper T lymphocytes and MHC-I interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes,"MHC Class II molecules interact with helper T lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells), while MHC Class I molecules interact with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). This is because MHC Class II presents antigens to CD4+ T cells, which are involved in the activation and regulation of immune responses, whereas MHC Class I presents antigens to CD8+ T cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity.",0.605,0.848,0.706
108,Identify the different types of T lymphocytes and their functions.,"T lymphocyte Function helper T lymphocytes activate in recognition to an antigen presented by a phagocyte (macrophage) prompt T lymphocytes to release cytokines and stimulate B lymphocytes to differentiate into plasma cells which multiply and secrete antibodies and memory B lymphocytes as a response stimulate the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cause macrophages to phagocytose more rapidly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (killer T cells) recognise and kill foreign, infected or abnormal host cells by releasing toxic compounds destroy the body cell by deteriorating its cell membrane or injecting enzymes that will kill the cell and prevent the pathogen from infecting any further suppressor T lymphocytes turn off the immune response once the antigen has been successfully contained, destroyed or removed memory T lymphocytes remain in the body (in the lymphatic system) ready to mobilise if reinfected with the same pathogen able to quickly proliferate (divide) into effector T cells to","There are two main types of T lymphocytes: CD4+ (also known as helper T cells) and CD8+ (also known as cytotoxic T cells). CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in activating other immune cells, such as B cells and macrophages, to fight infections. CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells or produce chemical signals that activate the immune response.",0.588,0.583,0.585
109,Explain why the lymphatic system is an important part of the adaptive immune response.,"The lymphatic system is an important part of the immune response generally because it is involved in the transport of immune cells throughout the body, and of adaptive immune responses specifically, because secondary lymphoid tissues are sites where antigen-presenting cells present antigens to lymphocytes, activating them and stimulating an adaptive immune response.","The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune response by acting as a transportation network for lymphocytes, such as T cells and B cells, to reach sites of infection or inflammation. It also filters out pathogens and toxins from the body fluids, presenting them to immune cells for recognition and response. The lymph nodes within the lymphatic system serve as critical checkpoints where immune cells can interact with antigens and become activated to mount an effective immune response. This process enables the body to develop specific immunity against future infections.",0.671,0.735,0.702
110,Define ' immunity'.,"The ability of a body or organism to recognise foreign substances, stimulate immune cells and kill and destroy the pathogen or foreign matter is known as immunity.","Immunity refers to the body's ability to defend itself against infectious organisms and other foreign substances. It involves a complex system of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to recognize and eliminate pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This defense mechanism can be acquired through vaccination or developed naturally after exposure to an antigen.",0.559,0.676,0.612
111,Describe the process of phagocytosis.,"Phagocytosis is the process by which phagocytes (e.g. macrophages) engulf other cells or particles—particularly foreign matter or pathogens. First, the phagocyte recognises the antigen of the pathogen as foreign and engulfs it. The cell membrane then forms a vacuole (called a phagosome) around it. Next, a lysosome, containing digestive enzymes, fuses with the phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. The digestive enzymes break down the pathogen and the antigen fragments are presented on the surface of the phagocyte by MHC-II molecules. The leftover fragments are then released from the cell by exocytosis.","Phagocytosis is a cellular process where a cell engulfs and consumes foreign particles or microorganisms, such as bacteria, dead cells, or debris. The process begins when a phagocyte, typically a white blood cell like a neutrophil or macrophage, recognizes the foreign particle through surface receptors. The phagocyte then extends pseudopodia to surround the particle, forming a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The contents of the phagosome are then digested and broken down by enzymes within the cell.",0.719,0.7,0.709
112,Distinguish between antibodies and antigens.,"Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are produced by B lymphocytes and released into the blood and lymph. Antibodies are proteins that bind to specific antigen molecules. The basic unit of an antibody molecule is a Y-shaped protein, formed by four polypeptide chains—two long heavy chains and two short light chains. Antibodies interfere with the function of the pathogen in a number of ways, including neutralising bacterial toxins, binding to antigens and activating phagocytes, and binding with soluble antigens causing them to precipitate out of solution. Antigens are unique molecules or parts of molecules that can be recognised by T lymphocytes or by antibodies produced by B lymphocytes. Antigens may be toxins, foreign substances, pathogens or parts of a pathogen that allow the body to recognise potentially harmful substances foreign to a body and mount an immune response against them. There are two main types of antigens: foreign antigens (heteroantigens) and non-foreign antigens (autoantigens). Antibodies induce an immune response to produce antibodies.","Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of foreign substances, such as viruses or bacteria, while antigens are the substances that trigger the production of these antibodies. In other words, antigens stimulate an immune response, which leads to the production of antibodies. Antibodies bind specifically to their corresponding antigens, helping to neutralize or remove them from the body. This interaction is a key part of the immune system's defense against infection and disease.",0.649,0.561,0.602
113,What is meant by the term 'emerging infectious disease'?,"Emerging infectious diseases are either new or previously unrecognised diseases; diseases that have increased in incidence, virulence or geographic range; or diseases that may increase in the near future","An emerging infectious disease refers to a new or previously rare disease that has recently appeared in a population or is increasing in incidence. This can include diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other pathogens that have not been commonly seen before or are becoming more prevalent due to various factors such as climate change, human migration, and antimicrobial resistance.",0.56,0.629,0.592
114,How can an organism become pathogenic and cause disease?,"New diseases emerge because of mutations in a pathogen, as well as when pathogens are exposed to a selection pressure (e.g. a drug) or adapt to a new host. Mutations may enable a pathogen to move to a new host. New mutations may increase the virulence, that is the ability of the pathogen to move into a wider range of hosts.","An organism becomes pathogenic when it undergoes genetic mutations or acquires new genes that enable it to infect and harm other organisms. This can occur through horizontal gene transfer from one bacterium to another, or through the acquisition of virulence factors such as toxins or adhesins. Additionally, environmental pressures and selection forces can drive the evolution of pathogenic traits in an organism. As a result, what was once a harmless microbe becomes a disease-causing agent.",0.576,0.62,0.597
115,Identify three human behaviours that can facilitate the spread of infectious disease.,"Answers may include: human-to-human contact, sexual activity, medical procedures.","Touching one's face, especially the eyes and mouth, after coming into contact with contaminated surfaces or individuals can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. Close proximity to others, such as in crowded areas or public transportation, increases the likelihood of transmission. Additionally, not covering one's mouth when coughing or sneezing can release droplets that contain pathogens, potentially infecting those nearby.",0.387,0.452,0.417
116,Name six procedures that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious disease.,1 hygiene practices 2 quarantine 3 vaccination 4 public health campaigns 5 use of pesticides 6 genetic engineering,"Hand hygiene, vaccination, quarantine, sterilization, disinfection, and proper waste disposal are six procedures that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. These measures help reduce the transmission of pathogens and protect individuals from infection. Regular cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces and equipment also play a crucial role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential in high-risk settings such as hospitals and clinics.",0.432,0.565,0.49
117,Explain the difference between active and passive immunity.,"Active immunity involves an individual’s own adaptive immune response. It takes time to develop, but the immunological memory that results can last for many years, even a lifetime. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies produced by another organism. This type of immunity is immediate, but will only protect the recipient for a few weeks or months because it does not result in immunological memory.","Active immunity occurs when an individual's body produces antibodies in response to direct exposure to a pathogen, such as through vaccination or infection. This type of immunity provides long-term protection against future infections. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of pre-formed antibodies from one individual to another, often through breastfeeding or immunoglobulin injections.",0.608,0.626,0.617
118,Provide an example of a public health crisis in Australia caused by infectious disease and describe the public health campaign.,"An example answer is: In July 1998 the Greater Western Sydney water supply was infected by high concentrations of the parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. An immediate public health campaign was launched. It included educating the public about the parasites and possible causes of water supply contamination as well as informing the public about the resulting treatment of the water supply. Information was disseminated through the media, schools and community organisations, as well as any locations where contact with contaminated water was likely (such as public pools and water fountains).","The 1919 Influenza Pandemic is an example of a public health crisis in Australia caused by infectious disease. The pandemic spread rapidly across the country, with over 50,000 reported cases and 4,500 deaths. To combat the outbreak, the Australian government launched a public health campaign that included the distribution of posters, pamphlets, and other educational materials to inform the public about the risks of influenza and how to prevent its spread. The campaign also involved the establishment of isolation hospitals and the implementation of quarantine measures at ports and borders.",0.574,0.579,0.577
119,Explain how antiseptics and disinfectants differ from antibiotics.,"Disinfectants are used to kill pathogens on surfaces. Antiseptics are used to kill pathogens on the body. They are nonspecific chemicals, killing or inactivating most viruses, bacteria and fungi. Antibiotics are used in the body and are specific for a group of bacteria","Antiseptics and disinfectants are substances that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on living tissues or inanimate surfaces, respectively. They work by denaturing proteins, disrupting cell membranes, or interfering with cellular processes, but do not target specific microbial pathogens. Antibiotics, on the other hand, are specifically designed to target and eliminate bacterial infections by inhibiting essential metabolic processes unique to bacteria. This targeted action allows antibiotics to be effective against a wide range of bacterial species without harming human cells.",0.589,0.687,0.635
120,List some ways in which antiviral drugs may limit the spread of a virus.,"Antiviral drugs can work by: • preventing the virus from entering the cell, by binding to receptors that allow the virus to enter • inhibiting enzymes that catalyse reproduction of the virus genome • inhibiting reverse transcriptase (for retroviruses) • blocking transcription and translation of viral proteins • preventing the viruses from leaving the cell, so they cannot infect other cells.","Antiviral drugs can limit the spread of a virus by reducing the viral load in an infected individual, thereby decreasing the likelihood of transmission to others. These medications can also help prevent the virus from replicating and spreading to other parts of the body. In some cases, antiviral drugs may be used as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection after exposure to a virus. This can be particularly effective in high-risk situations such as healthcare settings or among individuals with compromised immune systems.",0.575,0.597,0.586
121,How does antibiotic resistance arise and spread through bacterial populations?,Antibiotic resistance genes may already be present in the genome. They originate by mutation and can be passed to offspring in cell replication—all cells in a clone or colony of bacteria will have the resistance genes. They can be spread between bacteria by horizontal gene transfer—transferring plasmids that have resistance genes.,"Antibiotic resistance arises when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics, often through genetic mutations or horizontal gene transfer from other resistant bacteria. This can occur naturally in the environment or as a result of selective pressure from antibiotic use. As resistant bacteria multiply and outcompete susceptible ones, they can spread within bacterial populations, making infections harder to treat. Over time, this can lead to the emergence of ""superbugs"" that are highly resistant to antibiotics.",0.572,0.623,0.597
122,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease, above what is normally expected in that population in that area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.","An epidemic refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease within a specific geographic area, such as a city or region. A pandemic, on the other hand, is a widespread outbreak of a disease that affects multiple countries and often involves international travel and global spread. In essence, an epidemic is contained within a smaller area, while a pandemic has a much broader reach. This distinction highlights the severity and potential impact of a disease outbreak.",0.667,0.757,0.709
123,Describe herd immunity.,"Herd immunity is when a large number of people in a population are immune to a pathogen, reducing the chance of it successfully spreading through that population.","Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population is immunized against a disease, thereby protecting those who are unable or unwilling to receive vaccinations, such as young children and people with weakened immune systems. This creates a ""herd"" effect where the spread of the disease is significantly reduced or eliminated. The threshold for herd immunity varies depending on the disease, but it's generally considered to be around 80-95% of the population.",0.548,0.71,0.618
124,Differentiate between the incidence and prevalence of a disease.,"The incidence of disease is the rate of occurrence of new cases, indicating the risk of contracting the disease. The prevalence of disease measures the proportion of cases in the population at a given time, indicating how widespread the disease is.","Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specified period among a population at risk. Prevalence, on the other hand, is the total number of cases of a disease present in a population at a given time, including both new and existing cases. Incidence measures the rate of occurrence, while prevalence indicates the burden or extent of the disease in the population. This distinction is crucial for understanding the impact and management of a disease.",0.661,0.777,0.714
125,Provide two reasons why knowledge of Indigenous Australian bush medicine remains limited.,"Two example answers are: (1) Traditional Indigenous Australian knowledge is shared through oral tradition, as well as singing and dancing ceremonies rather than recorded in writing. (2) Little research has been conducted on Indigenous Australian bush medicine and healing practices.","The knowledge of Indigenous Australian bush medicine remains limited due to a lack of documentation and recording of traditional practices by European colonizers, which led to the loss of cultural heritage and medicinal knowledge. Additionally, many Indigenous Australians were forcibly removed from their lands and communities, disrupting the transmission of traditional knowledge from one generation to the next.",0.552,0.569,0.561
126,Identify some traditional roles of Indigenous Australian healers in bush medicine.,"Diagnosing, advising, reassuring and performing healing treatments.","Traditional Indigenous Australian healers played a significant role in bush medicine, using their knowledge of native plants and natural remedies to treat various ailments. They were skilled in identifying and preparing medicinal plants such as eucalyptus, tea tree, and quandong for use in treating conditions like fever, wounds, and skin infections. These healers also used spiritual and ritual practices to diagnose and treat illnesses, often believing that physical and spiritual health were interconnected. Their expertise was passed down through generations by word of mouth and hands-on training.",0.384,0.598,0.468
127,How do organisms exchange heat with their environment?,"Conduction occurs when the temperature of the organism and the environment are different. Heat exchange is a result of direct contact (e.g. a lizard basking on a warm rock). Convection is the transmission of heat from a warmer region to a colder region, resulting from the movement of liquid or gas (e.g. heat moves from the inside of living organisms to the body surface by convection). Radiation occurs all the time, without direct contact, regardless of temperature differences between the organism and their environment (e.g. heat radiating from dark coloured surfaces). Evaporation is heat loss by water evaporation. This occurs most rapidly when the air is hot and dry (e.g. sweating).","Organisms exchange heat with their environment through various mechanisms, including conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction occurs when direct contact is made between an organism and its surroundings, such as a warm-blooded animal touching a cold surface. Convection involves the movement of fluids or gases that carry heat away from an organism, like a fan blowing air over a person on a hot day. Radiation allows organisms to lose heat through electromagnetic waves, similar to how the sun's rays can warm up the Earth.",0.651,0.611,0.631
128,What are three mechanisms humans use to produce heat?,Answers may include: • voluntary movement/physical exercise • shivering thermogenesis • non-shivering thermogenesis • increasing rate of cellular respiration (metabolism).,"Humans produce heat through shivering, increased metabolism, and muscle activity. Shivering is a physical response that generates heat when the body temperature drops. Increased metabolism occurs when the body burns more calories than usual to produce heat, often seen in cases of fever or intense exercise. Muscle activity also produces heat as muscles contract and relax, generating internal warmth.",0.477,0.47,0.473
129,What are three mechanisms humans use to lose heat?,"Answers may include: • evaporative cooling, which occurs through sweating or perspiring • rate of cellular respiration decreases in internal organs, which decreases body temperature • covering your body with water, spraying water on your skin has the same effect as sweating • swimming will cause heat loss through conduction across the skin when you are in cool water; further cooling occurs when you are out of the water (evaporative cooling) • vasodilation is the dilation of the blood vessels in the skin; dilation means more blood is sent to the extremities; heat is lost to the environment by radiation and convection (especially if it is windy) • changing body shape to increase surface area • removing clothing will reduce the layer of insulation and allow heat to escape.","Humans lose heat through sweating, which evaporates and cools the body, radiation, where the body emits heat as infrared light, and convection, where warm air rises from the skin's surface. Additionally, humans also lose heat through evaporation of moisture from the respiratory system. This process is often referred to as ""breathing off"" excess heat.",0.6,0.526,0.561
130,"What is the main role of insulin, and how does this hormone function?",The overall effect of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels. It does this by: • increasing conversion of glucose to fat in fat cells • increasing uptake of glucose in muscle and fat cells • increasing the conversion of glucose to the storage compound glycogen for storage in the liver.,"Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. Its primary function is to facilitate the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into cells throughout the body, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Insulin acts as a key that unlocks cells, allowing glucose to enter and be used for energy production, growth, and maintenance. This process helps maintain normal blood sugar levels and prevents conditions such as hyperglycemia.",0.586,0.626,0.605
131,What are 'signalling molecules'?,Signalling molecules are chemicals involved in communication between cells within the body.,"Signalling molecules, also known as signaling proteins or ligands, are chemical messengers that transmit signals from one cell to another or within the same cell. They bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, triggering a cascade of intracellular responses that can lead to changes in gene expression, protein activity, or other cellular processes. Examples include hormones like insulin and adrenaline, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), and neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. These molecules play crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes.",0.441,0.718,0.547
132,Describe the feature of a target cell that makes it receptive to a particular signalling molecule.,Target cells have receptors that are specific to a particular signalling molecule; these receptors allow recognition of the signalling molecule and the target cells responds.,"The feature of a target cell that makes it receptive to a particular signaling molecule is the presence of specific receptors on its surface or within its cytoplasm. These receptors are molecules that bind to the signaling molecule, allowing it to interact with and trigger a response in the cell. The shape and chemical structure of the receptor are complementary to those of the signaling molecule, enabling them to bind together and initiate a signal transduction cascade. This binding event is highly specific and determines which cells will respond to the signaling molecule.",0.593,0.757,0.665
133,Which type of nervous system response protects the body,"The reflex response, which is an involuntary action to remove the body from further pain and injury","The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for protecting the body by regulating various involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. The ANS has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for ""fight or flight"" responses, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation and restoration. This response helps to conserve energy and maintain homeostasis in the body. It also helps to protect the body from physical harm by regulating functions such as sweating and pupil dilation.",0.453,0.624,0.525
134,Describe how adaptations are beneficial to the survival of an individual organism and to a species.,"Those organisms that are best suited to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous adaptations to their offspring. Adaptations help individual organisms survive and they are also critical for the survival and reproduction of populations and species. Adaptations are inherited characteristics and are the qualities that the theory of evolution by natural selection and the survival of the fittest are based on.","Adaptations enable an individual organism to survive by allowing it to cope with its environment, such as through camouflage for protection or specialized digestive systems for nutrient acquisition. These traits also contribute to the long-term survival of a species by enhancing its ability to reproduce and pass on advantageous characteristics to offspring. Adaptations can lead to increased fitness, improved resource utilization, and enhanced resistance to disease, ultimately benefiting the species' overall success and persistence. This, in turn, allows the species to thrive and evolve over time.",0.592,0.645,0.617
135,How does evaporative cooling work? Give examples of evaporative cooling in animals.,"When water on skin evaporates to gas, it transfers some of body’s heat to the atmosphere, causing cooling. Examples include humans sweating, kangaroos licking their forearm fur, and elephants wallowing in mud or spraying water","Evaporative cooling is a process where water evaporates from the surface of an object or animal, taking heat away and cooling the surrounding area. In animals, this can be seen in species such as camels and horses, which have large sweat glands that help to cool them down on hot days. The evaporation of sweat from these animals' coats helps to lower their body temperature, making it easier for them to regulate their internal heat. This process is also used by some insects, like ants, which can evaporate water from their bodies to cool themselves in hot environments.",0.552,0.593,0.572
136,What is the liver's role in homeostasis? Outline the mechanism for this control.,"The liver minimises the greater changes in blood glucose levels that would otherwise occur after meals. The liver converts excess glucose to glycogen. If the liver is full of glycogen, the liver converts any further excess of glucose to fat, which is stored in adipose tissue. After treatment, blood returning to the heart has a relatively normal level of glucose.","The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating various physiological processes, including metabolism, detoxification, and energy production. The liver achieves this through its ability to metabolize nutrients, filter toxins, and store glycogen, which helps maintain blood sugar levels. Additionally, the liver produces bile, which aids in fat digestion and absorption, further contributing to overall homeostasis. This control is maintained through a complex interplay of enzymes, hormones, and signaling pathways that allow the liver to adapt to changing physiological demands.",0.558,0.628,0.591
137,Give at least three examples of water-conserving adaptations in plants.,"Answers may include—reduced leaf area, tough cuticles, extensive root systems, strap-like leaves that may roll up during water shortages, leaves coated with fine hairs to cool the surface, water storage in tissues or stem, spines, spherical form.","Plants have evolved various water-conserving adaptations to survive in environments with limited water availability. Three examples include succulent leaves that store water, deep roots that access groundwater, and CAM photosynthesis which allows plants to conserve water by opening their stomata at night rather than during the day. Additionally, some plants have developed waxy or hairy surfaces on their leaves to prevent water loss through transpiration.",0.536,0.6,0.566
138,Why are all newborn babies tested for phenylketonuria (PKU) disease?,"Early detection of PKU enables caregivers to change the diet of the newborn, which prevents damage and reduces complications from the disease.","Newborns are tested for PKU because it is a genetic disorder that can cause severe intellectual disability and other serious health problems if left untreated. The test detects high levels of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood, which is a hallmark of PKU. Early detection allows for prompt treatment with a special diet to prevent brain damage and developmental delays. This screening is typically done as part of routine newborn testing.",0.546,0.675,0.603
139,What are oligodendrocytes?,Cells of the central nervous system that produce myelin.,"Oligodendrocytes are a type of glial cell in the brain that play a crucial role in myelination, which is the process of forming a fatty insulating layer called myelin around neuronal axons. This myelination process enables faster transmission of electrical signals along the axon, facilitating communication between neurons. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for producing and maintaining this myelin sheath, which is essential for normal brain function and development. They are found in the central nervous system, particularly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.",0.44,0.713,0.544
140,What is myelin composed of?,Lipids and some proteins.,"Myelin is primarily composed of lipids and proteins. It contains a high percentage of fatty substances called lipids, which provide insulation and facilitate the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibers. The main components of myelin are cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and galactocerebroside, along with proteins such as proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein. These components work together to form a compact, lipid-rich sheath that surrounds and protects axons in the nervous system.",0.38,0.59,0.462
141,What does a nutritional disease result from?,"Nutritional diseases can be caused by a lack of, imbalance or sometimes over-consumption of certain nutrients","A nutritional disease can result from an imbalance or deficiency of essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals in the diet. This can be caused by inadequate nutrition, poor dietary choices, or underlying health conditions that affect nutrient absorption. Malnutrition can also lead to various diseases, including scurvy, rickets, and beriberi.",0.562,0.727,0.634
142,Outline the term malnutrition and discuss the difference between undernutrition and overnutrition.,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers two broad categories: • undernutrition, which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies (including a lack of vitamins and minerals) • overnutrition, which includes obesity and diet-related non-infectious diseases.","Malnutrition refers to a condition where an individual's diet is inadequate or imbalanced, leading to nutritional deficiencies or excesses. Undernutrition occurs when the body does not receive sufficient nutrients, often resulting in weight loss, weakness, and impaired immune function. In contrast, overnutrition, also known as overfeeding or obesity, occurs when an individual consumes more calories than they need, leading to excessive weight gain and potential health problems. This distinction highlights the importance of achieving a balanced diet for optimal health.",0.628,0.629,0.628
143,List some of the major non-infectious disease risk factors associated with having a raised body mass index (BMI).,"Cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (such as osteoarthritis of the joints), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney and colon).","Individuals with a raised BMI are at increased risk for various non-infectious diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer such as breast and colon cancer, and osteoarthritis. Additionally, high BMI is also associated with an increased risk of sleep apnea and some respiratory problems like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, a raised BMI can also lead to musculoskeletal disorders like back pain and joint issues. These conditions are often linked to the physical strain and inflammation caused by excess body weight.",0.532,0.719,0.611
144,Discuss if a poor diet is the only contributor to the development of coronary heart disease.,"No, although poor nutrition is a contributing factor, other lifestyle aspects can also contribute to arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease including factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and obesity.","A poor diet is one of several contributors to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD), but not the only factor. Other significant contributors include physical inactivity, smoking, high blood pressure, and family history. A diet high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium can increase the risk of CHD by contributing to atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of plaque in the arteries. However, genetics, lifestyle factors, and other health conditions also play a role in its development.",0.585,0.693,0.634
145,What is the difference between non-specific and specific immunotherapies?,"Non-specific immunotherapies act indirectly, stimulating the immune response more generally, which can improve its response against cancer cells. Specific immunotherapies target cancer cells directly, stimulating an adaptive immune response against the cancer cells.","Non-specific immunotherapies stimulate the immune system in a general way, without targeting a specific disease or condition. Specific immunotherapies, on the other hand, target specific diseases or conditions by stimulating the immune system to recognize and attack specific antigens or cells. This targeted approach allows for more precise treatment and potentially fewer side effects. As a result, specific immunotherapies are often used to treat specific diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune disorders.",0.606,0.737,0.665
146,"What is the difference between chimeric, humanised and human monoclonal antibodies?","Chimeric monoclonal antibodies have a mixture of mouse and human components, whereas humanised monoclonal antibodies are mostly human components and human monoclonal antibodies consist entirely of human components.","Chimeric monoclonal antibodies are produced by combining a mouse antibody with a human antibody, resulting in a hybrid that retains some mouse sequences. Humanized monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, have most of their mouse sequences replaced with human ones, making them more compatible with the human immune system. Human monoclonal antibodies are entirely derived from human genes and do not contain any mouse sequences, making them the most human-like option. This results in reduced immunogenicity and improved safety profiles for humanized and human monoclonal antibodies compared to chimeric ones.",0.611,0.779,0.685
147,Bispecific antibodies are produced artificially. How are these antibodies different from those produced naturally by the immune system?,"The two antigen binding sites on naturally produced antibodies are identical and both bind to identical antigens, but the two binding sites on biospecific antibodies are different and bind to different antigens.","Bispecific antibodies produced artificially have a unique structure that allows them to bind two different antigens simultaneously, whereas natural antibodies produced by the immune system typically target a single antigen. This artificial design enables bispecific antibodies to engage multiple targets at once, which can be beneficial for treating certain diseases. In contrast, natural antibodies are highly specific and usually recognize a single epitope on an antigen. This specificity is crucial for the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self.",0.531,0.648,0.584
148,Describe how a tumour cell is able to evade the host immune response.,Tumour cells evade the host’s immune system by expressing defective MHC-I molecules (so that cytotoxic T lymphocytes cannot detect that the cells are defective). They produce immunosuppressive cytokines or release enzymes that suppress T lymphocyte responses.,"Tumour cells can evade the host immune response by suppressing the activity of immune cells such as T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells through various mechanisms. They can secrete immunosuppressive factors like transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which inhibits the activation and proliferation of immune cells. Additionally, tumour cells can also downregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on their surface, making it difficult for T-cells to recognize them as foreign. This allows the tumour cells to survive and proliferate despite the presence of an immune response.",0.613,0.669,0.64
149,"Define ""epidemiology"".",Epidemiology is the study of epidemics of infectious diseases in humans from developed countries.,"Epidemiology is the study of how diseases spread and can be controlled in a population. It involves analyzing data on disease patterns, risk factors, and outcomes to understand the causes and consequences of health events. Epidemiologists use this information to develop strategies for preventing and controlling infectious and non-infectious diseases. This field combines research, statistics, and public health principles to improve human health.",0.56,0.751,0.642
150,What is the difference between analytical studies in epidemiology and intervention studies?,"Analytical studies are planned investigations, which test a specific hypothesis. While intervention studies do not test a hypothesis but instead measure the effectiveness and safety of an intervention.","Analytical studies in epidemiology aim to identify associations or risk factors for a disease or outcome by analyzing existing data, whereas intervention studies involve testing a specific treatment or intervention to prevent or manage a disease. Intervention studies are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular strategy or program, often with a control group to compare outcomes. In contrast, analytical studies typically do not involve manipulation of the study environment or participants. This distinction allows researchers to understand causes and risk factors versus evaluating potential solutions.",0.577,0.699,0.632
151,Outline the six stages of collecting data for epidemiological studies.,"1 A diagnostic phase, in which the presence of the disease is confirmed. 2 A descriptive phase, which describes the populations at risk and the distribution of the disease within a population. This may then allow a hypothesis to be formed about the likely cause of a disease. 3 An investigative phase, which involves the implementation of a series of field studies. 4 An experimental phase, in which experiments are performed under controlled conditions to test the hypotheses in more detail. 5 An analytical phase, in which the results produced are analysed. 6 A decision-making phase, in which knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease is used to explore the various options available for managing health practices.","The six stages of collecting data for epidemiological studies are:

1. Planning and design: This stage involves defining the research question, selecting a study population, and determining the study design.
2. Data collection: This stage involves gathering data from various sources such as surveys, interviews, medical records, or laboratory tests.
3. Data processing: In this stage, the collected data is cleaned, coded, and formatted for analysis.
4. Data analysis: The processed data is then analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns and trends.
5. Interpretation: This stage involves interpreting the results in the context of the research question and study population.
6. Dissemination: Finally, the findings are communicated through reports, publications, or presentations to inform public health policy and practice.",0.604,0.623,0.613
152,Define the term 'public health program'.,"Public health programs are developed to improve the safety and health of communities through education, policy-making and research for disease prevention, treatment and cure.","A public health program is a planned and coordinated effort to prevent disease, promote health, and protect populations from health threats through evidence-based interventions and policies. These programs are typically implemented by government agencies, non-profit organizations, or healthcare systems to address specific health issues affecting communities. They often involve education, surveillance, research, and community engagement to achieve their goals. The ultimate aim of a public health program is to improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and populations.",0.603,0.736,0.663
153,What is population screening?,Population screening is a test offered to individuals in target groups to test or examine for non-infectious diseases.,"Population screening is a public health program that aims to identify and diagnose diseases or conditions in people who do not have symptoms, typically through regular testing of the entire population at risk. This approach helps detect problems early on, allowing for timely interventions and potentially improving outcomes. Population screening programs are often implemented for conditions like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",0.553,0.672,0.607
154,What is genetic engineering? Why is it an important area of research for non-infectious disease prevention?,"Genetic engineering is the ability to alter DNA. It is important in non-infectious disease prevention because there is potential for individuals to replace a defective, disease-causing gene or its protein product.","Genetic engineering involves the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology to alter its characteristics or traits. This field has become crucial in preventing non-infectious diseases by allowing scientists to develop genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that can produce therapeutic proteins, such as insulin and growth hormone, which can be used to treat various conditions like diabetes and growth disorders. Additionally, genetic engineering enables researchers to create crops with enhanced nutritional content or disease resistance, potentially reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases. This area of research holds significant promise for improving human health and quality of life.",0.549,0.689,0.611
155,Describe the two functions of the ear ossicles,"The three ear bones (ossicles) amplify (increase) the sound volume and transmit the vibrations from tympanic membrane to oval window, where they pass into the cochlea.","The ear ossicles, also known as the middle ear bones, have two primary functions. They transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear, allowing us to hear sounds clearly. Additionally, they help to protect the delicate structures of the inner ear by acting as a shock absorber and reducing the intensity of loud noises. This helps to prevent damage to the inner ear and maintain hearing health.",0.597,0.618,0.607
156,"Compare these three technologies that could be used to assist with hearing loss: hearing aid, bone conduction implant cochlear implant","All three technologies can at least restore awareness of sound and aid with lip reading skills. The hearing aid is the simplest, least expensive and can restore nearly normal hearing by amplifying external sounds. It only works if all the functions of the ear are essentially intact, just impaired. A bone conduction implant requires surgery and does not restore normal type hearing. It would be used for a person whose inner ear still functions but not the outer or middle ear. A cochlear implant is the most radical solution used for a person who has lost function of the cochlea but still has use of the auditory nerves. It gives sound awareness but not normal style hearing and is most useful when surgically installed during early childhood.","Hearing aids are wearable devices that amplify sound for individuals with mild to severe hearing loss. Bone conduction implants, also known as BAHA (Bone Anchored Hearing Aid), use a small device implanted in the skull to transmit sound through the bones of the face and skull, bypassing damaged or non-functioning outer ear structures. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted devices that directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals, providing a sense of sound for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss.",0.651,0.603,0.626
157,Describe two functions of the retina.,"When light rays from an object are focused on the retina an image of the object is formed and messages sent to the brain for interpretation. The cone photoreceptor cells in the retina detect different colours in bright light, especially in the central fovea (macula) position. The rod photoreceptor cells around the edges of the retina are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colours so they are most useful for detecting movement at night or in a darkened room.","The retina has two primary functions: it converts light into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, allowing us to perceive visual information; and it also regulates the amount of light that enters the eye through the process of pupil constriction or dilation.",0.565,0.548,0.556
158,Explain how the eye detects different colours.,"There are three types of cone cells, each with a photopsin pigment sensitive to different light wavelengths. They can distinguish between red, green and blue. Other colours are detected as a mix of stimulations and interpreted by the brain. If all three colour cones are equally stimulated, the brain knows from experience to see this as white.","The human eye contains specialized cells called cone cells that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, allowing us to perceive various colors. There are three types of cone cells, each sensitive to red, green, and blue light, which correspond to the primary colors. When light enters the eye, it stimulates one or more of these cone cells, sending signals to the brain that interpret the combination of stimulated cells as different colors. This process enables us to see a wide range of colors, from subtle pastels to vibrant hues.",0.668,0.701,0.684
159,Discuss the value of having binocular vision.,"Binocular vision requires two eyes quite close together facing forwards, such as humans have. The brain can then learn to use the two different images to form single 3D pictures and determine distance and relative sizes of the objects being viewed. This is valuable for playing sports, driving a vehicle, walking on uneven ground, on stairs, determining the position of things when we reach for them and so on. Personal safety often depends on being able to accurately judge distance and dimensions. Having both eyes facing forward does restrict the field of view, so animals that need to be more aware of prey and predators around them may get more value from eyes placed to the side with monocular vision (e.g. mice, lizards and snakes).","Having binocular vision allows for depth perception and a more accurate understanding of spatial relationships between objects. This is achieved by combining the slightly different perspectives from each eye, enabling individuals to judge distances and navigate through complex environments with greater ease. Binocular vision also enhances visual acuity and reduces the likelihood of misjudging object sizes or shapes. Overall, binocular vision plays a crucial role in everyday activities such as walking, driving, and sports.",0.646,0.572,0.607
160,"Arrange the following structures of the excretory system in order, from the largest in size to the smallest: nephron, glomerulus, kidney, renal capillary.","The largest is kidney, then nephron, glomerulus and renal capillary is the smallest structure","The correct arrangement is: kidney, nephron, glomerulus, and then there's no such thing as a ""renal capillary"" (it should be renal corpuscle or Bowman's capsule which is part of the glomerulus), but if you meant to ask about the blood vessels in the nephron, it would be renal artery, then arteriole, then peritubular capillaries.",0.568,0.715,0.633
161,Name the two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney.,ADH (antidiuretic hormone)—responds to water level and aldosterone—responds to salt level.,"The two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney are aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aldosterone helps regulate sodium levels by controlling its reabsorption in the kidneys, while ADH regulates water levels by affecting its reabsorption or excretion. This process is crucial for maintaining proper fluid balance and blood pressure in the body.",0.536,0.736,0.621
162,Describe two examples of a kidney disorder,"An example answer is: Nephrosclerosis—nephrosclerosis is caused by hypertension (high blood pressure) which can lead to hardening of the blood vessels in the kidney and loss of glomerular filtration function. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic condition that causes kidney malfunction and may eventually lead to kidney failure. The renal cortex and medulla regions in the kidney are overgrown with cysts preventing their normal functioning. Cysts are small sacs usually filled with fluid. OR any other kidney disease (e.g. glomerulonephritis [inflammation of kidney filters], diabetic nephropathy [kidney damage resulting from type 1 and type 2 diabetes], reflux nephropathy).","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their function over time. Two examples of kidney disorders are Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), a genetic disorder that causes numerous cysts to form on the kidneys, leading to damage and potential kidney failure. Another example is Nephrotic Syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive loss of protein in the urine due to damaged kidney filters. This can lead to swelling, fatigue, and other complications if left untreated.",0.67,0.604,0.635
