In sexual reproduction, gametes (sperm or egg cells) fuse to form a zygote, while in asexual reproduction, offspring develop from a single parent's cell or tissue. This results in genetic diversity through sexual reproduction and stability through asexual reproduction.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 4

[REASONING]: The candidate answer successfully fulfills all the criteria:

* **1 mark:**  Defines sexual reproduction accurately as involving the combination of genetic material from two parents to produce offspring with unique characteristics.
* **1 mark:** Defines asexual reproduction accurately as the production of offspring genetically identical to the parent without another individual involved.
* **1 mark:** Highlights the key distinguishing factor: genetic variation is a result of sexual reproduction, while asexual reproduction leads to genetically stable offspring.
* **1 mark:** While not explicitly stated, the answer implicitly provides examples:  sexual reproduction through the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg) and asexual reproduction through processes like budding or binary fission.

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies two locations of follicles: the skin/scalp for hair production and the ovaries for egg production (1 mark). It also accurately describes the function of a follicle as a protective sac that nourishes developing hair or eggs until release (1 mark).  
","A follicle is a small, usually rounded or oval structure found in various parts of the body, particularly in glands and organs. In the context of hair growth, a follicle refers to the tiny sac-like structure where hair roots reside. The primary function of a follicle is to produce and maintain hair, with each follicle containing multiple hair shafts that grow out from it. This process is essential for maintaining healthy and full-body hair growth.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies that follicles are found in glands and organs, particularly in the context of hair growth within tiny sac-like structures where hair roots reside. It also accurately describes the function of a follicle as producing and maintaining hair, with each follicle containing multiple hair shafts. Both the location and function are described clearly and concisely.  
","Unfortunately, the provided documents do not mention follicles.

","A follicle is not mentioned in the provided text. However, I can provide information on where to find a follicle.

In humans, a follicle is typically found in the ovaries, which are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries contain several types of follicles, including:

* Graafian follicles: These are mature follicles that contain an egg and are released from the ovary during ovulation.
* Dominant follicles: These are larger follicles that have a higher concentration of estrogen and are more likely to release an egg during ovulation.

In plants, follicles are not typically found. However, some plant structures can be referred to as ""follicles"" due to their resemblance in shape or function. For example, the flower buds on a stem can be thought of as follicles, but they are actually modified leaves that contain seeds.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

","The three phases of cell replication within a cell cycle are:

1. **Interphase**: This is the longest phase of the cell cycle, during which the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for cell division.
2. **Prophase**: During prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle forms to separate the chromosomes.
3. **Metaphase**: In metaphase, the chromosomes line up at the center of the cell, attached to the mitotic spindle, ready for separation during anaphase.

These phases are crucial for ensuring accurate DNA replication and proper cell division.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate correctly identifies and summarises Interphase (1 mark). They also identify Prophase and summarise it accurately, earning a second mark. However, they fail to mention Cytokinesis as the third phase and therefore do not receive the full three marks. 
","The three phases of cell replication within a cell cycle are:

1. G1 phase (growth), where the cell grows by producing proteins and more organelles.
2. S phase (synthesis), where DNA replication occurs, resulting in each chromosome being made of two identical chromatids.

Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms. Meiosis, on the other hand, is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four non-identical daughter cells with unique combinations of genetic traits.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 4

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly mentions both mitosis and meiosis (1 mark each).  It also accurately describes a feature of mitosis (genetically identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell, earning 1 mark) and a feature of meiosis (reducing the chromosome number by half resulting in four non-identical daughter cells with unique genetic combinations, earning 1 mark). 
","The two primary cell division processes are Mitosis and Meiosis. 

Mitosis is a type of interphase cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. It involves the replication of DNA, separation of chromosomes, and anaphase where sister chromatids separate to form individual chromosomes. This process occurs in somatic (body) cells and is essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues.

Meiosis, on the other hand, is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four non-identical daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It occurs in reproductive cells (sperm and egg cells) and is responsible for producing gametes (sperm and eggs). Meiosis involves two successive divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II, where homologous pairs of chromosomes separate and recombine during meiosis I, and then sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 4

It also accurately describes a feature of mitosis (the production of genetically identical daughter cells and the separation of sister chromatids) and a feature of meiosis (the reduction of chromosome number by half and the formation of gametes). 


","The two cell division processes are mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is a process that results in two identical daughter cells with an exact copy of the DNA structure in each nucleus. Meiosis, on the other hand, is not mentioned in the provided documents, but it's known to be a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells, resulting in four non-identical daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 3

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly mentions both mitosis and meiosis.  They also accurately describe a key feature of mitosis (resulting in two identical daughter cells with an exact copy of the DNA). However, the candidate's description of meiosis is incomplete and mentions that it is not found in the provided documents. While this might be true, it does not fulfill the criteria for mentioning a feature of meiosis.  


","Here's a concise response:

The two main cell division processes are mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is characterized by the separation of chromosomes into identical daughter cells during four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Meiosis, on the other hand, involves the reduction of chromosome number by half, resulting in four non-identical daughter cells.

In mitosis, DNA replication occurs before cell division, followed by the condensation of chromatin and the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase. The separation of chromosomes into identical daughter cells occurs during anaphase, while telophase follows, where the nucleus divides and cytoplasm splits.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 4

Denaturation can be reversible or irreversible, depending on the extent of the disruption. As a result, denatured proteins often aggregate or precipitate out of solution.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly defines denaturation as the disruption or unfolding of a protein's native, three-dimensional structure.  It also accurately describes the consequences of denaturation, including the unwinding of the polypeptide chain, loss of functional conformation, and potential loss of biological activity. The answer also touches on the reversibility of denaturation and the tendency of denatured proteins to aggregate or precipitate. 


Therefore, the candidate answer satisfies both criteria for full marks.  
","A protein becomes denatured when its native, three-dimensional structure is disrupted, causing it to lose its normal conformation and fold into an unfolded or misfolded state. This can occur due to various factors such as heat, chemicals, or physical stress, leading to a loss of function and often resulting in the protein's aggregation or precipitation. Denaturation can have significant effects on the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules. In some cases, denatured proteins may still retain some functional properties, but their overall behavior and performance are significantly altered.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

* **1 mark:** The candidate accurately describes what happens to the protein during denaturation: it unfolds or misfolds, loses function, may aggregate or precipitate, and its activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules are altered. 


The answer is comprehensive and demonstrates a good understanding of protein denaturation. 
","A protein becomes ""denatured"" when its active site's shape has been deformed and can no longer bind to substrates, meaning it can no longer function or return to its original state. This can be caused by extremes of pH, temperature, or other factors that disrupt the protein's structure, leading to a loss of its biological activity. Denaturation is usually permanent and results in the protein becoming non-functional.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly defines denaturation as a change in shape of a protein's active site that prevents it from functioning (1 mark). It also accurately describes the consequences of denaturation, including the loss of biological activity and the potential for permanent structural changes (1 mark).  
","A protein becomes denatured when its active site's shape has been deformed and it can no longer bind to substrates, meaning it cannot function or return to its original state. This occurs due to extreme temperatures (above 37°C) or pH levels that cause the enzyme to lose its native structure and fold. As a result, individual amino acids in the protein start vibrating excessively, leading to breakage of hydrogen bonds and ultimately causing the protein to fragment.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer successfully defines denaturation as a loss of shape and function in a protein due to disruption of its native structure. They correctly identify that this results in the inability to bind substrates and perform its original role.  The explanation also touches on the causes (temperature and pH) and some of the consequences (vibrating amino acids, breakage of hydrogen bonds).

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies that silent mutations are called ""silent"" because they do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein.  They also accurately explain this phenomenon by referencing the degeneracy of the genetic code and how multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Both points fulfill the criteria for awarding the full 2 marks. 
","Silent mutations, also known as non-synonymous mutations or point mutations, are called ""silent"" because they do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. In other words, these mutations do not alter the primary structure of the protein, and therefore, the resulting protein is likely to have the same function as the original one. Silent mutations can still lead to changes in protein function or activity, but they do not cause a change in the protein's three-dimensional structure. As a result, silent mutations are often referred to as ""silent"" because they do not disrupt the normal functioning of the protein.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies silent mutations and explains their effect.  It states that silent mutations do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein, which earns the first mark. It further elaborates on this by stating that these mutations don't alter the protein's primary structure and function, earning the second mark. 


","Silent mutations are called ""silent"" because they produce no change to the polypeptide encoded, despite being a point mutation in a coding region of the DNA. This is due to the genetic code being degenerate, meaning that more than one codon can code for the same amino acid. As a result, the altered base codon triplet still codes for the same amino acid, leading to no phenotypic change.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies that silent mutations are called ""silent"" because they do not produce a change in the polypeptide sequence despite being a point mutation in a coding region of DNA.  It further explains this phenomenon by mentioning the degeneracy of the genetic code and how alternative codons can code for the same amino acid, resulting in no phenotypic change. Both criteria are fulfilled. 
","Silent mutations occur when a point mutation in a coding region of the DNA changes the amino acid encoded, but does not affect the phenotype of the organism. This is because the genetic code is degenerate, meaning that more than one codon can encode the same amino acid.

For example, sickle cell anemia is an example of a silent mutation where a point mutation in the HBB gene causes a change from glutamic acid to valine at position 6, resulting in the production of abnormal hemoglobin. This mutation does not cause any changes in the phenotype of the individual, despite being present in the DNA.

In contrast, missense mutations result in a change to the amino acid encoded by the mutated codon, leading to a different protein product and potentially a changed phenotype. Nonsense mutations, on the other hand, result in a premature stop codon, cutting off the protein production process altogether.

The term ""mutation"" is used to refer to any changes that occur in the sequence of bases within an organism. Germ-line mutations are those that occur in gametes (eggs or sperm) and can be inherited into the next generation, while somatic mutations occur in non-reproductive cells and do not pass on to future generations.

Silent mutations are called ""silent"" because they do not result in a change to the phenotype of the organism. Instead, they may affect gene expression or protein function, but these effects are typically subtle and not noticeable in the individual's life.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer clearly mentions silent mutations and explains that they occur when a point mutation changes the amino acid encoded but does not affect the organism's phenotype. This explanation is accurate and demonstrates an understanding of the concept.

* **Second Function:** ""Additionally, they amplify sound waves by converting them into mechanical energy that can be detected by the cochlea in the inner ear."" This correctly explains the role of amplification necessary for hearing a range of frequencies. 


Therefore, the candidate answer satisfies both criteria and earns full marks.","The two main functions of the ear ossicles are to transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear, and to amplify these vibrations for better sound quality. The stapes bone plays a crucial role in transmitting sound vibrations to the oval window, which then transmits them to the cochlea in the inner ear. This process allows us to perceive different frequencies of sounds. In summary, the ear ossicles work together to convert sound waves into electrical signals that are interpreted by the brain as sound.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly defines both functions of the ear ossicles.  

* **Function 1:** ""transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear"" is clearly stated.
* **Function 2:** ""amplify these vibrations for better sound quality"" is also accurately described. 


Therefore, both criteria are met, earning the candidate the full 2 marks.  
","The ear ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) have two main functions: to amplify and transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the oval window, and to pass these vibrations on to the fluid in the cochlea, causing it to vibrate at the same frequency. This amplification and transmission of vibrations is essential for converting sound energy into mechanical energy that can be interpreted by the brain.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

","The two main functions of the ear ossicles are to amplify and transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the fluid in the cochlea, where they cause the hair cells to bend and generate nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain for interpretation. The hammer bone (attached to the eardrum) vibrates and amplifies the sound energy, while the anvil and stirrup bones amplify the vibrations further, ultimately passing them onto the oval window on the cochlea. This process allows the ear to convert mechanical energy into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly defines both functions of the ear ossicles. 

* **Function 1:** ""amplify and transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the fluid in the cochlea"" - This accurately describes how the ossicles transfer and intensify sound waves.
* **Function 2:**  ""...cause the hair cells to bend and generate nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain for interpretation."" - This explains the ultimate purpose of the vibration transmission, which is to stimulate the auditory system and create a neural signal representing sound.

Name the two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney.,ADH (antidiuretic hormone)—responds to water level and aldosterone—responds to salt level.,2,"1 mark = mentions one correct hormone

1 mark = mentions another correct hormone ","The two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney are aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aldosterone helps regulate sodium levels by controlling its reabsorption in the kidneys, while ADH regulates water levels by affecting its reabsorption or excretion. This balance is crucial for maintaining proper fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the body.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2

[REASONING]: The candidate answer correctly identifies both aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) as hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney.  Therefore, they receive both marks according to the criteria. 
","The two primary hormones involved in regulating salt and water balance in the human kidney are aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal glands and stimulates the kidneys to retain sodium ions, which increases blood volume and pressure. In contrast, ADH, also known as vasopressin, is released by the hypothalamus and promotes water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidneys, concentrating the urine and reducing its volume. Together, these hormones play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis in the body.","[EVALUATED MARKS]: 2
