2,Distinguish between sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction,"Sexual reproduction, such as meiosis, is the process of forming a new organism from the fusion of the offspring's parent's gametes. Comparatively, asexual reproduction, such as mitosis, is the process of producing an offspring from just one parent through cell division or mitosis. 

The offspring as a result of sexual reproduction does not have genetic material that is identical to its parents. The offspring from asexual reproduction is a clone of its parent, meaning it has the same allele combinations as its parent.",4,"1 mark = Define sexual reproduction

"
15,How does artificial insemination differ from in vitro fertilisation (IVF)?,Artificial insemination involves the delivery of semen directly into the female reproductive system.
