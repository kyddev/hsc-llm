ID,QUESTION,ANSWER
1,Define 'asexual reproduction',"Asexual reproduction is a type of reproductive process in which offspring are produced from one parent without the involvement of gametes (sex cells). In this process, the genetic material from two separate parents is combined to produce offspring that are genetically identical to both parents."
2,Identify the sort of cell division that is involved in asexual reproduction,"The cell division in asexual reproduction is mitosis, which produces an extra set of identical paired chromosomes."
3,Outline the ideal environmental conditions for asexual reproduction and explain why these conditions are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms,"Stable and uniform environments with a good supply of resources provide ideal conditions for asexual reproduction. These environments are ideal for asexually reproducing organisms because organisms that are produced via asexual reproduction are clones of their parent already adapted to the stable environment. Since the parent is surviving in the ideal environment, the offspring will also be well suited to this environment, resulting in a large successful population for this organism. However, they will lack the genetic variation required for adaptation to changing conditions."
4,List the key events in binary fission for bacteria,"The key events that happen in binary fission for bacteria goes as follows:

1. The circular DNA molecule is duplicated within the nucleoid. 
2. The cell grows until it has almost doubled in size. 
3. A new cell wall and membrane form between the separating chromosomes, dividing the cell into two relatively equal halves. 
4. These halves eventually separate, forming two identical daughter cells from the single parent cell."
5,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a gamete? Give an example of each,"Somatic cells are all the diploid cells in the body of an organism, apart from the sex cells (gametes). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells. Gametes are the haploid sex cells such as the egg/ovum and sperm cells, that combine in sexual reproduction. They are produced from germ cells by meiosis

"
6,Explain the meaning of the term 'alternation of generations',The term ‘alternation of generations’ means the swapping between haploid (1n) and diploid (2n) stages in the life cycle of eukaryotes undergoing sexual reproduction. An example is the diploid mushroom fruiting body that produces haploid spores for the next stage.
7,Compare pollination in gymnosperm and angiosperm plants,"Both gymnosperms and angiosperms produce haploid male gametes contained inside pollen grains. 

The difference is in the way that cross-pollination occurs. All cone plants (gymnosperms) are wind pollinated, that is, they produce very lightweight pollen in great quantities on male cones and release it into the air to be carried by wind. By chance some will pollinate female cones of the same gymnosperm species. 

Most flowering plants (angiosperms) have adaptations for more reliable cross-pollination, often involving a symbiotic relationship with an animal. Insects (especially bees), birds and small mammals are attracted to the flowers by colour or scent. They get rewards of nectar or pollen and in the process carry pollen grains from one flower to the next. Some angiosperms are wind-pollinated but most have evolved the more efficient pollination partnership with an animal species."
8,Classify the three groups of mammals based on reproductive strategies and give two examples for each group,"All mammals have fur and feed their young with milk. There are three groups based on reproductive strategies: 

1. placental mammals—female carries fetus inside her body, nourished through a placenta until fully developed (e.g. human, dog, lion, elephant and whale) 
2. marsupial mammals—fetus born at an early stage, complete their development in external pouch while suckling (e.g. kangaroo, koala, wombat and quokka) 
3. monotreme mammals—female lays eggs with leathery shells then protects them and feeds the young with milk after hatching (e.g. platypus and echidna)
"
9,"Distinguish between zygote, morula, blastocyst, gastrula, embryo and fetus","Zygote is the first stage after fertilisation, the diploid cell that results from fusion of a haploid egg and sperm. 

Morula is the next stage after the zygote undergoes mitosis to become two cells. The morula continues to divide until it consists of 16 cells and then enters the uterus. 

Blastocyst is the next stage when the morula has divided by mitosis into many smaller cells that are organised into two layers. 

Gastrula develops from the blastocyst when three layers of cells have formed. 

Embryo is the next stage until major organs have developed. In humans this stage is from three to eight weeks after fertilisation (or five to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period). 

Fetus is the final stage of development when all of the major organs have developed. This stage lasts until birth."
10,Where would you find an acrosome and what is its function?,"The acrosome is a specialized structure at the front (or anterior) of a sperm cell. It contains enzymes called acroplasms or hyaluronidases, which break down the outer layers around an egg (oocyte) to facilitate fertilization."
11,Where would you find a follicle and what is its function?,"A follicle is a group of cells in the ovary that surround an oocyte as it matures. The follicle provides protection and nutrition to the egg, then ruptures to release the egg through the surface of the ovary for ovulation."
12,Compare reproduction in placental and marsupial mammals,"Both placentals and marsupials are viviparous, that is they bear live young. The difference is that marsupial young are born at a very early stage of their development before they are fully formed. The young must crawl up into the maternal pouch, attach to a nipple and complete their development in the external pouch. The mother can then start another cycle of reproduction and does not have the burden of growing the young in her uterus. Placental females nourish the fetus inside the uterus until it is fully formed. Some placental young can start moving around independently within minutes after birth (e.g. calves, lambs and foals). The young are better protected during fetal development, but the mother is more restricted by the period of gestation and cannot breed again until after the birth."
13,"Explain how two glands positioned in the brain, the hypothalamus and the pituitary, can control the reproductive organs","The hypothalamus acts as a master control centre, receiving information by nerve messages and by monitoring the blood as it flows through this area of the brain. It maintains homeostatic balance and reproductive processes for the body by sending out nerve messages and/or releasing hormones to other appropriate glands. The pituitary is thus controlled by messages from the hypothalamus for release of its hormones to act on target cells in the reproductive system. Hormones from the pituitary gland travel in the blood to their targets such as the mammary glands, the ovaries and testes. Some pituitary hormones act directly and others stimulate release of local hormones that act on their target cells by diffusing through the extracellular fluid."
14,Identify the steps of artificial selection that would lead to the production of large corn cobs,"The steps of artificial selection that would lead to production of large corn cobs include:

1. Select corn plants with the largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
2. Select offspring plants with largest cobs for cross-pollination. 
3. Continue this process until the population reliably produces large cobs."
15,Outline how selective breeding has changed with the development of new technology,"Selective breeding traditionally used cross breeding over many generations. However, new technology allows desired genes to be transferred more rapidly and accurately, and allows creation of transgenic species."
16,Identity two common methods of plant propagation used in selective breeding,"Artificial pollination ensures that only the chosen male plant will fertilise the new seeds. Plant cuttings, grafting and using runners or suckers will produce identical plants for the next generation (e.g. for growing bananas commercially)."
17,Outline four methods of cloning currently used in horticulture and agriculture,"The cloning methods used in agriculture and horticulture are: 
• cuttings and grafting 
• plant tissue culture 
• embryo splitting 
• nuclear transfer."
18,Recall a situation where plant tissue culture is of benefit,"An endangered species could be saved by producing many new plants from a small piece of the rare parent plant. This strategy has been used for the Wollemi pine. Mass production of food plants with tissue culture saves time, money and reduces land use."
19,Discuss the case for and against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture. Use some specific examples in your answer.,"• For the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—Many benefits come from selective breeding
 evidenced by the fact that all our agricultural plants and animals have been improved for human use by controlling
 their breeding. We have more nutritious and palatable fruit like apples and grain crops. Farm animals are more
 productive for milk, eggs and meat.
 • Against the manipulation of plant and animal breeding in agriculture—One risk is that a GM species could start
 breeding with related wild species such as the GM salmon. We also risk a further reduction in natural genetic variation.
 There are also many ethical concerns around selectively breeding animals and the consequences for their welfare."
20,"Within a cell cycle, cell replication involves three phases. Identify and summarise the three phases.","The cell cycle involves three phases: interphase, mitosis and cytokinesis.
 Interphase involves the cell doubling its mass and duplicating all its components. DNA replication occurs during
 interphase.
 Mitosis is a process of division of the cell nucleus.
 Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells."
21,"Identify the two types of cell division, the number of daughter cells produced and the number of chromosomes in these daughter cells.","There are two types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis.

Mitosis: This process produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each having twice the number of chromosomes (2n). Mitosis is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in eukaryotes.
Meiosis: Meiosis reduces the number of chromosomes by half, resulting in four genetically distinct daughter cells. Each gamete has n chromosomes (23 in human sperm and egg). Meiosis increases genetic diversity, allowing for recombination and shuffling of alleles during sexual reproduction."
22,Recall the events that occur during interphase of the cell cycle,"During the S phase of interphase, DNA is synthesised (chromosomes are replicated); during G1 and G2—normal
 functioning of the cell occurs, the cell increases in size and replicates organelles, and materials are accumulated for
 mitosis; G0—resting phase or phase in which cells undergo cell differentiation to become specialised."
23,Distinguish between a chromatid and a chromosome. When are they visible?,"Chromatids are replicates of the chromosome, joined at the centromere. When they separate at anaphase they are
 again called chromosomes. Chromosomes and chromatids become visible under a light microscope when they
 condense in prophase (and stay visible through metaphase, anaphase and telophase)."
24,Explain how cell division in plants is different from cell division in animals,"Plant cells do not usually have a centriole (a structure present in animal cells); they form spindle fibres by a different
 mechanism, so chromosomes align and chromatids separate as in other eukaryotic cells. During cytokinesis the
 membrane does not constrict as it does in animals, but a new division (the cell plate) forms across the cell, making a
 new cell wall, then new cell membranes for each daughter cell."
25,"Define 'apoptosis'. Explain the reasons for this process in a healthy organism, providing examples.","Apoptosis is a natural and highly controlled process of cell death within a multicellular organism. It is used to control
 the number of cells, to destroy cells with DNA damaged beyond repair and remove cells that have reached their ‘useby date’ or are surplus to body requirements. Examples in humans include: old red and white blood cells, damaged
 skin and intestinal lining cells, monthly menstruation to remove the extra lining of the uterus if pregnancy hasn’t
 occurred; in a developing human embryo: removal of excess brain cells and webbing between the digits. Examples in
 plants include: the root cap cells are destroyed by apoptosis and replaced as penetration into the soil damages them.
 Destruction of targeted cells for these reasons helps keep an organism renewed and healthy."
26,Outline the basic functions of DNA and RNA.,DNA carries the instructions that code for the production of RNA and proteins. DNA can self-replicate. RNA plays a major role in partnership with DNA for the process of protein synthesis
27,"Distinguish between these terms: chromosome, DNA. genome, gene and allele.","A chromosome is a package of a single, very long DNA molecule coiled around a series of histone proteins.
 DNA is the molecule that contains the genetic information of organisms and determines their inherited characteristics.
 The genome of an organism is the sum total of an organism’s DNA, measured in the number of base pairs, contained
 in a haploid (n) set of chromosomes.
 A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a polypeptide. One or more polypeptides form proteins, which carry out
 functions in organisms.
 An allele is one of two or more alternative forms of the same gene (e.g. alleles for different eye colours)."
28,"Using the terms chromosome, histone, DNA and nucleosome, describe how DNA is packaged into a cell nucleus","A long thread of DNA is packed up so that it fits into the nucleus of every cell. The DNA in each chromosome is tightly
 coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. The combined loop of DNA and histone
 is called a nucleosome. Next the nucleosomes are packaged into a thread, which is sometimes described as ‘beads
 on a string’. The end result is a fibre known as chromatin. The chromatin is looped and coiled again to produce a
 super-coiled thread-like structure called a chromosome."
29,How do cells ensure that the DNA is copied correctly to the daughter cells?,"A strand of the parent DNA molecule is used as a template strand on which the new complementary strand is
 synthesised. As each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old and one newly synthesised strand, the exact DNA
 pattern can be replicated accurately."
30,Assess the role of enzymes in DNA replication,"Enzymes are vital to the process of DNA replication, which would not begin or proceed without them. For example,
 separate enzymes manage the unzipping and rezipping of the two DNA strands. DNA polymerase is a complex of
 enzymes that selects and attaches the correct bases to the new strand and checks for errors at a rapid pace. Another
 enzyme manages the twisting tension of the double helix. Replication would not be possible without enzymes."
31,Recall the names of the two cell division processes and define their main features.,"Mitosis—produces identical new cells for growth and repair
 Meiosis—produces sex cells (gametes) for sexual reproduction with a different combination of alleles to the parent cell"
32,Write a definition of ' species'.,"Members of the same species:
 • look alike (they are more alike in appearance than other organisms)
 • can interbreed in nature and their offspring are fertile (if they reproduce sexually)
 • cannot interbreed successfully with organisms outside their species group
 • have the same, or very similar, habitat requirements (i.e. have similar geographical distributions)."
33,Examine the importance of cell division to a eukaryotic organism.,"Eukaryotes have two types of cell division—mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the basis of cell replication in unicellular
 eukaryotes. In multicellular eukaryotes, mitosis is used for growth, cell replacement and tissue repair. Meiosis is the
 basis of sexual reproduction in multicellular eukaryotes. It is essential to produce gametes, and enables two parents to
 contribute genetic information to the offspring and maintain genetic variation in new generations of offspring."
34,Examine some of the main differences in gene regulation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.,"In eukaryotic cells, transcription and RNA processing occur within the nucleus, while translation occurs in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic gene expression is more complex and can be regulated at any stage. In prokaryotic cells, gene expression consists only of transcription and translation, and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells (as prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles). Here, transcription and translation occur at almost the same time. Gene expression in prokaryotes is regulated during transcription."
35,Explain why the chromosomes of eukaryotic cells can be seen under a light microscope but those of prokaryotes cannot,"The prokaryote chromosome contains only coding regions and no extra non-coding DNA. Also, a prokaryote is a
 simple single cell with many less genes. Eukaryote cells are more complex with many more genes and much longer
 DNA that includes a lot of introns. The extra amount of DNA will only fit into a nucleus if it is tightly condensed and
 super-coiled around histone proteins. This packaging makes eukaryotic DNA large enough to be visible as thread-like
 linear chromosomes when stained and viewed under a light microscope. The single prokaryote chromosome does not
 pack tightly together and is only visible as a dark nucleoid region."
36,Name the three types of RNA and outline their basic functions.,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries a copy of the nucleotide sequence of DNA that specifies the amino acid sequence for
 a protein. The mature mRNA travels from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it binds to ribosomes ready for translation.
 Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms a small organelle called a ribosome, which is the site at which the information in the
 mRNA is translated into a chain of amino acids.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules transfer amino acids from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes, where they are joined to
 form a polypeptide chain. The sequence of the chain is based on the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA."
37,Identify the three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes.,"The three stages of polypeptide synthesis in eukaryotes include: 
1. transcription which is the synthesis of mRNA
2. RNA processing, where the pre-mRNA is refined into mature mRNA
3. translation, as the polypeptide chain constructed at the ribosome from code on mature mRNA"
38,Outline the main structural features of eukaryotic genes and their functions.,"stop and start codons—regions at which encoding DNA begins and ends for a specific gene
 promoter regions—an upstream binding region for the enzyme that is involved in the encoding process
 (which is RNA polymerase)
 exons—DNA regions that are coding segments
 introns—DNA regions that are non-coding segments"
39,"Proteins are key components of cells. Outline, with
 examples, at least five different roles carried out by
 proteins.","Proteins have various functions in cells/organisms. They act as enzymes to catalyse all biochemical reactions, form structural components of cells and organs, are involved in movement (e.g. as contractile fibres in cells), are embedded in cell and organelle membranes as well as being involved in the transport of materials across membranes. They are also involved in the transport of substances such as oxygen in red blood cells by bonding to haemoglobin protein, for signal transduction, cell recognition, communication (e.g. as hormones like oestrogen) or antibodies involved in immune defence."
40,Distinguish between the proteome and proteomics.,"A proteome is the complete set of proteins in an individual organism. Proteomics is the scientific study of the proteins, including the use of technologies that assist in studying and understanding proteins."
41,Compare fibrous and globular proteins,"Fibrous proteins are elongated with little or no tertiary folding, usually insoluble and have have structural roles like keratin in fingernails. Whilst globular proteins are compactly folded and coiled into spherical tertiary and quaternary structures, usually soluble such as enzymes and hormones are globular proteins."
42,Explain what is meant by a protein becoming 'denatured'.,"A protein is said to be denatured when the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces that create the tertiary structure of the protein are broken and the shape of the protein is altered."
43,Outline the factors that can cause a protein to become denatured.,A protein is denatured when it is exposed to temperatures above its optimum temperature and sometimes when the protein is exposed to pH levels higher or lower than its optimum pH.
44,Explain the difference between the genotype and phenotype of an individual.,A genotype is the combination of alleles that an individual has for the characteristic being investigated. The phenotype of the individual is the trait that a given genotype expresses. The environment also plays a role in the expression of the phenotype.
45,Describe an example where an organism's phenotype can be affected by the environment in which it is raised.,"An example answer is—Flower colour in hydrangeas is affected by the pH of the soil,
 which affects the availability of aluminium in the soil to the plant. Therefore, plants with the same genotype can have
 different colour phenotypes."
46,What is meant by the term 'monohybrid cross'?,Monohybrid crosses are crosses between two individuals with different alleles at a single genetic locus. These crosses are performed to determine which trait is dominant.
47,What is the Law of Independent Assortment and what does it state?,"Mendel’s second law of inheritance, the Law of Independent Assortment, states that the alleles of a gene controlling one trait assort independently of alleles of another gene controlling a different trait."
48,What are the possible outcomes of meiosis in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb? List all the gametes that this individual could produce.,"The possible outcomes of meiosis (gametes) in a heterozygote individual with the genotype AaBb (for unlinked genes, or linked genes after crossing over) are AB, Ab, aB, ab."
49,List one way in which population genetics is useful for conservation purposes,Population genetics can be used to measure and monitor genetic variation in a population; track invasive species; and discover and define new species.
50,List three characteristics of an ideal genetic marker and explain why they are necessary in population genetic analyses.,"The genetic marker must (1) be polymorphic in the population of interest, or it will not contain any useful information; (2) be a neutral marker (i.e. not under selection) as the analytical models usually assume random distribution of alleles; (3) be affordable and relatively easy to work with, as most projects have a limited budget."
51,Define 'genetic testing'.,"Genetic testing is a medical test used to detect specific alleles, mutations, genotypes or karyotypes that are associated with heritable traits, diseases or predispositions to diseases."
52,What are the three main m ethodologies used in genetic sequencing and profiling?,Molecular genetic testing; cytogenetic testing-karyotyping and molecular cytogenetic testing via fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH); biochemical genetic testing.
53,What is an STR? List the steps for determining a DNA profile by STR analysis.,"An STR is a short tandem repeat. They are short repeat sequences of DNA scattered throughout the genome. 
To make a DNA profile: 
• extract DNA from a tissue sample 
• amplify the STRs using PCR (different primers for different STRs) 
• run the PCR products on a gel or capillary electrophoresis 
• compare the bands on a gel or the peaks on the graph."
54,What was the original goal of the Human Genome Project?,"The original goal was to determine the complete human genome, the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA
 molecule and the number of genes in one human individual."
55,List two reasons that genetic variation is important for the long-term survival of a gene pool.,"Genetic variation means that populations are more able to adapt to changes and challenges in the environment, because natural selection acts upon genetic variation. Genetic variation acts as a buffer against the accumulation of dangerous mutations, as it reduces the chances of inbreeding."
56,Why are frameshift mutations more significant than substitution point mutations?,A substitution mutation only alters one codon; a frameshift mutation alters every codon after the mutation.
57,2 Explain why silent mutations are called 'silent'.,"Silent mutations are silent because they do not change the amino acid that they code for, and as such they have no functional change in terms of protein products."
58,state which chromosome is affected and whether the chromosome is in excess or missing. a Down syndrome,chromosome 21; one additional copy (trisomy 21)
59,What is a neoplasm?,A neoplasm is a mass of tissue formed by uncontrolled cell division.
60,Give two examples of each of the following: a sources of chemical mutagens b physical mutagens c biological mutagen,"a Sources of chemical mutagens—acceptable answers include mustard gas, ethidium bromide, chemicals contained in tobacco, outdoor air pollution, coffee, nuts, tomatoes, pineapples, herbs, spices, mushrooms, cadmium and arsenic. b Physical mutagens—acceptable answers include particle radiation: nuclear fission, nuclear fusion; high energy electromagnetic radiation (EMR): X-rays, gamma rays and high energy ultraviolet light. c Biological mutagens—acceptable answers include oncoviruses (direct or indirect) such as HTLV-1 and human papillomavirus (HPV) and transposable elements (TEs, transposons)."
61,Explain how proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes can cause cancer.,"Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell growth. When these genes are unregulated, cell growth increases, causing tumours/ cancers/neoplasms. Tumour-suppressor genes inhibit cell division. If these genes are damaged, cell division can go unregulated, causing tumours/cancers/neoplasms"
62,Is the following statement true or false? Mutations to non-coding regions of ONA will not have an effect on the organism. Explain your answer.,False. These mutations interfere with the transcription process; a gene could become partially or entirely non-functional.
63,Describe the process by which intrans are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule during transcription.,"During the transcription process, the introns (which do not code for proteins) must be removed to create functional mRNA. The removal is known as splicing and requires a protein complex known as a spliceosome. The spliceosome is made up of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles or snRNPs. This spliceosome binds to three recognised sequences along the intron: one at the 5′ end (known as the 5′ junction) one at the 3′ end (the 3′ junction) and one near the 3′ end (the branch point) that allows the intron to fold into a loop before it is removed. After the intron is removed, the exons can join together to create an mRNA molecule with a neat, continuous coding sequence"
64,What is a deep intronic mutation?,A deep intronic mutation is a mutation that is located more than 100 nucleotides from the 5′ or 3′ junctions between the intron and the exon.
65,What is the difference between a somatic cell and a germ cell? Give an example of each.,"Somatic cells are all the cells in the body of an organism, apart from the gametes (egg and sperm cells). Examples of somatic cells include skin cells, muscle cells and nerve cells"
66,Explain how an error in meiosis can lead to Down syndrome.,"An error in meiosis is caused by non-disjunction of chromosomes/chromatids, where chromosomes/chromatids do not separate. Non-disjunction can occur between homologous chromosomes during anaphase I or between chromatids during anaphase II. Errors in meiosis occur during gamete (sperm or egg) formation. Down syndrome is due to an extra chromosome 21 where a gamete receives two copies of chromosome 21. As a result the zygote (offspring) has three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) instead of two and a total of 47 chromosomes instead of 46."
67,Why is polyploidy more common in plants than animals?,"Polyploidy is more common in plants than animals because many plants can reproduce by asexual reproduction. For example, a triploid plant (3n) is typically sterile or has low fertility because of problems with chromosome pairing during meiosis and gamete formation. But it could survive by vegetative reproduction. Fewer complex animals can reproduce asexually, so polyploidy that results in sterility is less common."
68,Define the term 'biotechnology'.,"Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary technology, which uses biological processes and organisms to create new products and develop new technologies."
69,Define the term 'selective breeding' and provide an example of its application in ancient times.,"Selective breeding is a process where the animals or plants that express desired characteristics are bred together to produce offspring that will also show these characteristics. Examples will vary but may include horses, which have been bred for different uses such as ploughing, racing and dressage."
70,Identify the significant scientific event that marked the commencement of modern biotechnology.,The discovery of DNA.
71,Describe the positive social impacts of the GM crop Golden Rice.,"Answers may vary but could include: improved health and nutrition to some of the poorest communities, reduced vitamin A deficiency in some of the poorest communities, the success of Golden Rice has promoted the development of further GM crops."
72,Explain why a religion or culture may oppose the use of transgenic animals.,"Some religions restrict certain foods. While a transgenic animal may appear to be of one species, it may contain some genetic elements of species, which members of different religious groups choose not to eat. Some cultures may also have ethical reasons for opposing the use of transgenic animals."
73,Describe how genetic variation can benefit agricultural biotechnology.,"Genetic variation improves the evolutionary potential of populations, species, cultivars and breeds of organisms. This improves their long-term stability and the potential to develop new plant cultivars and animal breeds."
74,Explain how the increased use of a species for biotechnology could cause biodiversity loss.,"If a species is increasingly used for biotechnology, its value rises. This could lead to overexploitation and endangerment of the species."
75,Differentiate between in situ and ex situ conservation methods.,"In situ practices maintain the organism in its natural environment, whereas ex situ methods conserve organisms outside of their natural environment (e.g. in zoos)."
76,Define the term 'artificial insemination',Artificial insemination is a reproductive technology that involves the deliberate introduction of male sperm into the female reproductive tract by a method other than sexual intercourse.
77,What advantages does artificial insemination bring to agriculture?,"Answers may vary but could include: • multiple females can be impregnated from one sample • females in different geographic locations to the male can be impregnated • farmers don’t have to keep male animals on their property • avoids behavioural challenges associated with mating animals • reproductive health of population protected through screening of semen samples • requires no animal-to-animal contact, avoiding the spread of disease."
78,How does artificial insemination differ from in vitro fertilisation (IVF)?,Artificial insemination involves the delivery of semen directly into the female reproductive system. Whereas IVF removes the egg from the female and fertilises it with the sperm in a laboratory setting prior to returning the fertilised egg back into the female uterus.
79,What is artificial twinning? How does it differ from the birth of natural identical twins?,"Artificial twinning splits an embryo in two very early in the development process. Both halves of the embryo continue to divide leading to two separate individuals with identical genetic make-up. Artificial embryo twinning differs from natural identical twin development as it is carried out in a laboratory petri dish, with the early embryo artificially separated into individual cells and allowed to continue dividing. The embryos are then transferred into a surrogate mother."
80,Explain the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer.,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer involves the removal of chromosomes from an egg cell and replaces them with the nucleus of a somatic cell taken from the organism being cloned. The egg cell is then induced to divide. Once the embryo has developed, it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate female organism. The individual that is born following gestation will be an identical genetic copy of the animal from which the original somatic cell was taken."
81,Describe the term 'gene therapy'.,Gene therapy refers to the insertion of a gene into an individual’s cells to correct or replace defective gene function that leads to disease.
82,What types of human proteins are commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology?,"Human proteins commonly produced by recombinant DNA technology are hormones, enzymes, vaccines and cytokines."
83,What is a plasmid? Describe the role played by plasmids in gene cloning.,"A plasmid is a circular molecule of bacterial DNA. Plasmids are useful in gene cloning. They replicate frequently within the bacterial cell. When a foreign gene such as the human insulin gene is inserted into bacterial plasmids and the bacteria are cultured, large amounts of the protein (insulin) can be produced by the bacteria."
84,Describe a genetically modified organism and compare it to a transgenic organism.,"A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism that has an alteration to one or more genes due to gene transfer, mutagenesis or gene editing. Transgenic organisms are a subset of GMOs; they have a gene from a different source inserted into their genome (e.g. a plant with a bacterial insecticide gene, a mouse with a human antibody gene, or a goat with a spider silk protein gene)."
85,Identify two advantages of artificial insemination for human fertility treatment,Artificial insemination is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive procedure.
86,Define the term 'xenotransplantation'.,"Xenotransplantation involves the transplantation of cells, tissues or organs from a donor species to a different species (e.g. from a non-human donor species to a human)."
87,Provide an example of a therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology in medicine.,Answers may vary but could include: • epidermal growth factor used in the treatment of burns to improve the survival of skin grafts • interleukin-2 used in cancer treatment • antibodies for immunotherapy • vaccines against a number of viruses.
88,Outline the chain of infection.,infectious agent → reservoir → portal of exit → mode of transmission → portal of entry → susceptible host
89,Name three portals of exit in human hosts,"Respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract or skin"
90,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in a population of an area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people."
91,Compare germ theory to the theory of spontaneous generation.,Germ theory replaced spontaneous generation as the explanation for the occurrence and transmission of disease. Spontaneous generation states that life can arise from non-living matter while germ theory states that life comes from existing living matter.
92,What are Koch's four postulates?,"1 The microorganism must be present in the tissues of the infected organism and not in a healthy organism. 2 The microorganism must be able to be cultivated in isolation from the infected organism. 3 When an uninfected organism is then inoculated with the culture, it should develop symptoms of the disease. 4 Samples from the second infected organism should be able to be isolated and found to be the same as the microorganism from the first infected organism."
93,Explain one limitation of Koch's postulates.,answers should include either: asymptomatic carriers do not meet postulate 1; pathogens such as viruses that cannot be cultured and so do not meet postulates 2 and 3.
94,Give two examples of pathogens that cause disease in plants,"Student answers may vary. The following are some examples: Phytophthora infestans, which causes potato blight; Fusarium oxysporum, the cause of Panama disease; Phytophthora cinnamomi, the cause of root rot or dieback disease."
95,What is a zoonotic disease? Give an example of this type of disease.,"A zoonotic disease is a disease that has passed from an animal host to a human. An example is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, which can be transmitted to humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)."
96,Describe antigenic variation. What is the purpose of this adaptation in pathogens?,"Antigenic variation is the ability of pathogens to change their antigens (molecules on cells/pathogen surface that can induce an immune response in the host). Antigenic variation allows the pathogen to avoid recognition by the host’s immune system upon secondary exposure, giving the pathogen more time to colonise its host"
97,Briefly describe how HIV overcomes the host's immune response.,HIV uses the host’s T lymphocytes which direct coordination of the immune response. HIV has a protein on its surface that binds to receptors on T lymphocytes and hijacks those cells to make replicates of the virus.
98,How does sneezing advance transmission of pathogens?,Some pathogens have adaptations that cause the host to produce extra mucus and cause discomfort resulting in sneezing. Sneezing can spread pathogens much faster and further to susceptible hosts than through direct skin-to-skin contact.
99,Distinguish between disease caused by viruses and those caused by bacteria.,Viral pathogens rely on their viral envelope and capsid to penetrate host cells. Once a virus infects a host plant it can either result in a localised infection or it can move apoplastically or symplastically through the plant to become a systemic infection. Bacteria enter host plants via the stomata or other small wounds/openings. Once they have infected the plant they can move apoplastically to travel around the plant.
100,Determine how you would distinguish between a healthy and a diseased plant,"Observing the colour and appearance of a plant is essential to determining whether the plant is healthy or unhealthy. Healthy plants typically exhibit stems which are straight and not wilted, leaves which are of a dark green colour and not discoloured or misshapen. Flowers of healthy plants are brightly coloured and plentiful. Healthy plants do not have lesions or other abnormal growths and may have multiple stems which are thicker. Unhealthy plants on the other hand exhibit discolouration in leaves and stems and flowers are not present or are very few. Plants that are suffering from disease may also exhibit wilting, dieback and organ deformities (leaf curling and excessive growths) especially when infections produce galls and other lesions."
101,List at least three physical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals,The physical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry are: • skin—which prevents entry of pathogens into the body • cilia—help to move mucus and other debris into the stomach or out of the body • peristalsis—aids in the movement of secretions (mucus) or foreign invaders to the stomach to kill pathogenic organisms.
102,List at least three chemical barriers that aid in the prevention of pathogen entry into animals.,"The chemical barriers that help to prevent pathogen entry into an animal are typically bodily secretions such as: • mucus—a sticky substance that traps pathogens and other foreign matter that enters the body • sebum—an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands that make the skin slightly acidic to prevent pathogenic organisms from growing on the skin and entering the body • cerumen—an oily waxy substance produced by the glands in the ear canal that helps to trap foreign substances and pathogens • acidic secretions (stomach, urogenital)—provide an acidic environment which pathogens are unable to tolerate and aid in the destruction of pathogenic organisms • lacrimal secretions—produced by the tear ducts they contain enzymes and other substances that break down bacterial cell walls and prevent infection by washing away debris and other foreign matter • lysozymes—enzymes found in secretions such as saliva, mucus and tears. This enzyme breaks down bacterial cell walls"
103,How are microflora necessary for the health of an animal?,"Microflora are beneficial bacteria that inhabit the skin, mouth, nose, throat, lower part of the gastrointestinal tract and the urogenital tract in healthy individuals. Microflora plays an important role in keeping pathogenic organisms from inhabiting an animal. The presence of microflora prevents the growth and colonisation of other bacteria because microflora compete with pathogenic bacteria for space and resources, and produce chemicals that reduce the pH of the micro-environment."
104,Outline the main components of the innate immune system,"The main components of the innate immune system are a number of specialised types of white blood cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells), a number of proteins and enzymes (e.g. lysozymes, cytokines, and complement proteins), inflammatory responses (involving histamines and prostaglandins), and apoptosis (programmed cell death)."
105,Phagocytes are important cells of the innate immune system. What is the function of some phagocytes that links the innate and adaptive immune systems?,"Some phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes. It is this antigen presentation that links the innate and adaptive immune systems."
106,Distinguish between neutrophils and macrophages.,"This information may be presented in a table and diagrams drawn for further distinguishable features of both cells. Neutrophils are one of the most abundant white blood cells and a type of phagocyte. They can be distinguished by vesicles within their cytoplasm, which contain antimicrobial proteins to destroy pathogenic organisms. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and may live for a few hours. Macrophages on the other hand are matured monocytes. Macrophages work by ingesting pathogens in a phagosome. The cell membrane of the macrophage then binds with a lysosome (containing digestive enzymes) that dissolves the contents of the phagosome. Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells and aid in the recognition of an invader by initiating T and B lymphocytes to be released. Macrophages may live for several months engulfing pathogenic organisms."
107,Which MHC class interacts with helper T lymphocytes. and which interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes?,MHC-II interacts with helper T lymphocytes and MHC-I interacts with cytotoxic T lymphocytes
108,Identify the different types of T lymphocytes and their functions.,"T lymphocyte Function helper T lymphocytes activate in recognition to an antigen presented by a phagocyte (macrophage) prompt T lymphocytes to release cytokines and stimulate B lymphocytes to differentiate into plasma cells which multiply and secrete antibodies and memory B lymphocytes as a response stimulate the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cause macrophages to phagocytose more rapidly cytotoxic T lymphocytes (killer T cells) recognise and kill foreign, infected or abnormal host cells by releasing toxic compounds destroy the body cell by deteriorating its cell membrane or injecting enzymes that will kill the cell and prevent the pathogen from infecting any further suppressor T lymphocytes turn off the immune response once the antigen has been successfully contained, destroyed or removed memory T lymphocytes remain in the body (in the lymphatic system) ready to mobilise if reinfected with the same pathogen able to quickly proliferate (divide) into effector T cells to"
109,Explain why the lymphatic system is an important part of the adaptive immune response.,"The lymphatic system is an important part of the immune response generally because it is involved in the transport of immune cells throughout the body, and of adaptive immune responses specifically, because secondary lymphoid tissues are sites where antigen-presenting cells present antigens to lymphocytes, activating them and stimulating an adaptive immune response."
110,Define ' immunity'.,"The ability of a body or organism to recognise foreign substances, stimulate immune cells and kill and destroy the pathogen or foreign matter is known as immunity."
111,Describe the process of phagocytosis.,"Phagocytosis is the process by which phagocytes (e.g. macrophages) engulf other cells or particles—particularly foreign matter or pathogens. First, the phagocyte recognises the antigen of the pathogen as foreign and engulfs it. The cell membrane then forms a vacuole (called a phagosome) around it. Next, a lysosome, containing digestive enzymes, fuses with the phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. The digestive enzymes break down the pathogen and the antigen fragments are presented on the surface of the phagocyte by MHC-II molecules. The leftover fragments are then released from the cell by exocytosis."
112,Distinguish between antibodies and antigens.,"Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are produced by B lymphocytes and released into the blood and lymph. Antibodies are proteins that bind to specific antigen molecules. The basic unit of an antibody molecule is a Y-shaped protein, formed by four polypeptide chains—two long heavy chains and two short light chains. Antibodies interfere with the function of the pathogen in a number of ways, including neutralising bacterial toxins, binding to antigens and activating phagocytes, and binding with soluble antigens causing them to precipitate out of solution. Antigens are unique molecules or parts of molecules that can be recognised by T lymphocytes or by antibodies produced by B lymphocytes. Antigens may be toxins, foreign substances, pathogens or parts of a pathogen that allow the body to recognise potentially harmful substances foreign to a body and mount an immune response against them. There are two main types of antigens: foreign antigens (heteroantigens) and non-foreign antigens (autoantigens). Antibodies induce an immune response to produce antibodies."
113,What is meant by the term 'emerging infectious disease'?,"Emerging infectious diseases are either new or previously unrecognised diseases; diseases that have increased in incidence, virulence or geographic range; or diseases that may increase in the near future"
114,How can an organism become pathogenic and cause disease?,"New diseases emerge because of mutations in a pathogen, as well as when pathogens are exposed to a selection pressure (e.g. a drug) or adapt to a new host. Mutations may enable a pathogen to move to a new host. New mutations may increase the virulence, that is the ability of the pathogen to move into a wider range of hosts."
115,Identify three human behaviours that can facilitate the spread of infectious disease.,"Answers may include: human-to-human contact, sexual activity, medical procedures."
116,Name six procedures that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious disease.,1 hygiene practices 2 quarantine 3 vaccination 4 public health campaigns 5 use of pesticides 6 genetic engineering
117,Explain the difference between active and passive immunity.,"Active immunity involves an individual’s own adaptive immune response. It takes time to develop, but the immunological memory that results can last for many years, even a lifetime. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies produced by another organism. This type of immunity is immediate, but will only protect the recipient for a few weeks or months because it does not result in immunological memory."
118,Provide an example of a public health crisis in Australia caused by infectious disease and describe the public health campaign.,"An example answer is: In July 1998 the Greater Western Sydney water supply was infected by high concentrations of the parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. An immediate public health campaign was launched. It included educating the public about the parasites and possible causes of water supply contamination as well as informing the public about the resulting treatment of the water supply. Information was disseminated through the media, schools and community organisations, as well as any locations where contact with contaminated water was likely (such as public pools and water fountains)."
119,Explain how antiseptics and disinfectants differ from antibiotics.,"Disinfectants are used to kill pathogens on surfaces. Antiseptics are used to kill pathogens on the body. They are nonspecific chemicals, killing or inactivating most viruses, bacteria and fungi. Antibiotics are used in the body and are specific for a group of bacteria"
120,List some ways in which antiviral drugs may limit the spread of a virus.,"Antiviral drugs can work by: • preventing the virus from entering the cell, by binding to receptors that allow the virus to enter • inhibiting enzymes that catalyse reproduction of the virus genome • inhibiting reverse transcriptase (for retroviruses) • blocking transcription and translation of viral proteins • preventing the viruses from leaving the cell, so they cannot infect other cells."
121,How does antibiotic resistance arise and spread through bacterial populations?,Antibiotic resistance genes may already be present in the genome. They originate by mutation and can be passed to offspring in cell replication—all cells in a clone or colony of bacteria will have the resistance genes. They can be spread between bacteria by horizontal gene transfer—transferring plasmids that have resistance genes.
122,Distinguish between an epidemic and a pandemic.,"An epidemic is the sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease, above what is normally expected in that population in that area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people."
123,Describe herd immunity.,"Herd immunity is when a large number of people in a population are immune to a pathogen, reducing the chance of it successfully spreading through that population."
124,Differentiate between the incidence and prevalence of a disease.,"The incidence of disease is the rate of occurrence of new cases, indicating the risk of contracting the disease. The prevalence of disease measures the proportion of cases in the population at a given time, indicating how widespread the disease is."
125,Provide two reasons why knowledge of Indigenous Australian bush medicine remains limited.,"Two example answers are: (1) Traditional Indigenous Australian knowledge is shared through oral tradition, as well as singing and dancing ceremonies rather than recorded in writing. (2) Little research has been conducted on Indigenous Australian bush medicine and healing practices."
126,Identify some traditional roles of Indigenous Australian healers in bush medicine.,"Diagnosing, advising, reassuring and performing healing treatments."
127,How do organisms exchange heat with their environment?,"Conduction occurs when the temperature of the organism and the environment are different. Heat exchange is a result of direct contact (e.g. a lizard basking on a warm rock). Convection is the transmission of heat from a warmer region to a colder region, resulting from the movement of liquid or gas (e.g. heat moves from the inside of living organisms to the body surface by convection). Radiation occurs all the time, without direct contact, regardless of temperature differences between the organism and their environment (e.g. heat radiating from dark coloured surfaces). Evaporation is heat loss by water evaporation. This occurs most rapidly when the air is hot and dry (e.g. sweating)."
128,What are three mechanisms humans use to produce heat?,Answers may include: • voluntary movement/physical exercise • shivering thermogenesis • non-shivering thermogenesis • increasing rate of cellular respiration (metabolism).
129,What are three mechanisms humans use to lose heat?,"Answers may include: • evaporative cooling, which occurs through sweating or perspiring • rate of cellular respiration decreases in internal organs, which decreases body temperature • covering your body with water, spraying water on your skin has the same effect as sweating • swimming will cause heat loss through conduction across the skin when you are in cool water; further cooling occurs when you are out of the water (evaporative cooling) • vasodilation is the dilation of the blood vessels in the skin; dilation means more blood is sent to the extremities; heat is lost to the environment by radiation and convection (especially if it is windy) • changing body shape to increase surface area • removing clothing will reduce the layer of insulation and allow heat to escape."
130,"What is the main role of insulin, and how does this hormone function?",The overall effect of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels. It does this by: • increasing conversion of glucose to fat in fat cells • increasing uptake of glucose in muscle and fat cells • increasing the conversion of glucose to the storage compound glycogen for storage in the liver.
131,What are 'signalling molecules'?,Signalling molecules are chemicals involved in communication between cells within the body.
132,Describe the feature of a target cell that makes it receptive to a particular signalling molecule.,Target cells have receptors that are specific to a particular signalling molecule; these receptors allow recognition of the signalling molecule and the target cells responds.
133,Which type of nervous system response protects the body,"The reflex response, which is an involuntary action to remove the body from further pain and injury"
134,Describe how adaptations are beneficial to the survival of an individual organism and to a species.,"Those organisms that are best suited to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous adaptations to their offspring. Adaptations help individual organisms survive and they are also critical for the survival and reproduction of populations and species. Adaptations are inherited characteristics and are the qualities that the theory of evolution by natural selection and the survival of the fittest are based on."
135,How does evaporative cooling work? Give examples of evaporative cooling in animals.,"When water on skin evaporates to gas, it transfers some of body’s heat to the atmosphere, causing cooling. Examples include humans sweating, kangaroos licking their forearm fur, and elephants wallowing in mud or spraying water"
136,What is the liver's role in homeostasis? Outline the mechanism for this control.,"The liver minimises the greater changes in blood glucose levels that would otherwise occur after meals. The liver converts excess glucose to glycogen. If the liver is full of glycogen, the liver converts any further excess of glucose to fat, which is stored in adipose tissue. After treatment, blood returning to the heart has a relatively normal level of glucose."
137,Give at least three examples of water-conserving adaptations in plants.,"Answers may include—reduced leaf area, tough cuticles, extensive root systems, strap-like leaves that may roll up during water shortages, leaves coated with fine hairs to cool the surface, water storage in tissues or stem, spines, spherical form."
138,Why are all newborn babies tested for phenylketonuria (PKU) disease?,"Early detection of PKU enables caregivers to change the diet of the newborn, which prevents damage and reduces complications from the disease."
139,What are oligodendrocytes?,Cells of the central nervous system that produce myelin.
140,What is myelin composed of?,Lipids and some proteins.
141,What does a nutritional disease result from?,"Nutritional diseases can be caused by a lack of, imbalance or sometimes over-consumption of certain nutrients"
142,Outline the term malnutrition and discuss the difference between undernutrition and overnutrition.,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers two broad categories: • undernutrition, which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies (including a lack of vitamins and minerals) • overnutrition, which includes obesity and diet-related non-infectious diseases."
143,List some of the major non-infectious disease risk factors associated with having a raised body mass index (BMI).,"Cardiovascular diseases, stroke, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (such as osteoarthritis of the joints), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney and colon)."
144,Discuss if a poor diet is the only contributor to the development of coronary heart disease.,"No, although poor nutrition is a contributing factor, other lifestyle aspects can also contribute to arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease including factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and obesity."
145,What is the difference between non-specific and specific immunotherapies?,"Non-specific immunotherapies act indirectly, stimulating the immune response more generally, which can improve its response against cancer cells. Specific immunotherapies target cancer cells directly, stimulating an adaptive immune response against the cancer cells."
146,"What is the difference between chimeric, humanised and human monoclonal antibodies?","Chimeric monoclonal antibodies have a mixture of mouse and human components, whereas humanised monoclonal antibodies are mostly human components and human monoclonal antibodies consist entirely of human components."
147,Bispecific antibodies are produced artificially. How are these antibodies different from those produced naturally by the immune system?,"The two antigen binding sites on naturally produced antibodies are identical and both bind to identical antigens, but the two binding sites on biospecific antibodies are different and bind to different antigens."
148,Describe how a tumour cell is able to evade the host immune response.,Tumour cells evade the host’s immune system by expressing defective MHC-I molecules (so that cytotoxic T lymphocytes cannot detect that the cells are defective). They produce immunosuppressive cytokines or release enzymes that suppress T lymphocyte responses.
149,"Define ""epidemiology"".",Epidemiology is the study of epidemics of infectious diseases in humans from developed countries.
150,What is the difference between analytical studies in epidemiology and intervention studies?,"Analytical studies are planned investigations, which test a specific hypothesis. While intervention studies do not test a hypothesis but instead measure the effectiveness and safety of an intervention."
151,Outline the six stages of collecting data for epidemiological studies.,"1 A diagnostic phase, in which the presence of the disease is confirmed. 2 A descriptive phase, which describes the populations at risk and the distribution of the disease within a population. This may then allow a hypothesis to be formed about the likely cause of a disease. 3 An investigative phase, which involves the implementation of a series of field studies. 4 An experimental phase, in which experiments are performed under controlled conditions to test the hypotheses in more detail. 5 An analytical phase, in which the results produced are analysed. 6 A decision-making phase, in which knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease is used to explore the various options available for managing health practices."
152,Define the term 'public health program'.,"Public health programs are developed to improve the safety and health of communities through education, policy-making and research for disease prevention, treatment and cure."
153,What is population screening?,Population screening is a test offered to individuals in target groups to test or examine for non-infectious diseases.
154,What is genetic engineering? Why is it an important area of research for non-infectious disease prevention?,"Genetic engineering is the ability to alter DNA. It is important in non-infectious disease prevention because there is potential for individuals to replace a defective, disease-causing gene or its protein product."
155,Describe the two functions of the ear ossicles,"The three ear bones (ossicles) amplify (increase) the sound volume and transmit the vibrations from tympanic membrane to oval window, where they pass into the cochlea."
156,"Compare these three technologies that could be used to assist with hearing loss: hearing aid, bone conduction implant cochlear implant","All three technologies can at least restore awareness of sound and aid with lip reading skills. The hearing aid is the simplest, least expensive and can restore nearly normal hearing by amplifying external sounds. It only works if all the functions of the ear are essentially intact, just impaired. A bone conduction implant requires surgery and does not restore normal type hearing. It would be used for a person whose inner ear still functions but not the outer or middle ear. A cochlear implant is the most radical solution used for a person who has lost function of the cochlea but still has use of the auditory nerves. It gives sound awareness but not normal style hearing and is most useful when surgically installed during early childhood."
157,Describe two functions of the retina.,"When light rays from an object are focused on the retina an image of the object is formed and messages sent to the brain for interpretation. The cone photoreceptor cells in the retina detect different colours in bright light, especially in the central fovea (macula) position. The rod photoreceptor cells around the edges of the retina are sensitive to dim light but cannot detect colours so they are most useful for detecting movement at night or in a darkened room."
158,Explain how the eye detects different colours.,"There are three types of cone cells, each with a photopsin pigment sensitive to different light wavelengths. They can distinguish between red, green and blue. Other colours are detected as a mix of stimulations and interpreted by the brain. If all three colour cones are equally stimulated, the brain knows from experience to see this as white."
159,Discuss the value of having binocular vision.,"Binocular vision requires two eyes quite close together facing forwards, such as humans have. The brain can then learn to use the two different images to form single 3D pictures and determine distance and relative sizes of the objects being viewed. This is valuable for playing sports, driving a vehicle, walking on uneven ground, on stairs, determining the position of things when we reach for them and so on. Personal safety often depends on being able to accurately judge distance and dimensions. Having both eyes facing forward does restrict the field of view, so animals that need to be more aware of prey and predators around them may get more value from eyes placed to the side with monocular vision (e.g. mice, lizards and snakes)."
160,"Arrange the following structures of the excretory system in order, from the largest in size to the smallest: nephron, glomerulus, kidney, renal capillary.","The largest is kidney, then nephron, glomerulus and renal capillary is the smallest structure"
161,Name the two hormones responsible for regulating salt and water in the human kidney.,ADH (antidiuretic hormone)—responds to water level and aldosterone—responds to salt level.
162,Describe two examples of a kidney disorder,"An example answer is: Nephrosclerosis—nephrosclerosis is caused by hypertension (high blood pressure) which can lead to hardening of the blood vessels in the kidney and loss of glomerular filtration function. Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic condition that causes kidney malfunction and may eventually lead to kidney failure. The renal cortex and medulla regions in the kidney are overgrown with cysts preventing their normal functioning. Cysts are small sacs usually filled with fluid. OR any other kidney disease (e.g. glomerulonephritis [inflammation of kidney filters], diabetic nephropathy [kidney damage resulting from type 1 and type 2 diabetes], reflux nephropathy)."
